3946	8061	What a start, what a start.
8082	10250	I mean you can't do it any better than that.
10310	14867	That's one way to start a match up with a clean ace between Luca Raleigh and Talis there.
16973	17934	There's the old story.
17954	21878	If you can split two of them, they either both go for it, or at night of them go for it.
21898	22579	They both leave it.
22859	23600	That's what he got there.
23620	24842	And they both had to go for that one.
24862	26223	It's another beautiful serve.
26864	28405	That'll get picked up by Yamamoto.
28445	29507	He'll do a lot of that.
29547	32049	And then Nishida pops up far side.
32109	33030	That's contained.
33351	36714	Fernando will set up the Piper tag.
36734	38797	And that's a bit of a surprise.
40959	42741	Oh, that pushed too long.
42981	43682	Two attacks.
44062	45664	No kills yet for Brazil.
47534	54164	down 0-2 here very early on, but not perhaps the greatest start that the Brazilians were looking for.
55085	56147	Yeah, Luca really pushing it.
57509	58591	Nishida with another ace.
58871	60834	And again, he's got both of them going for it.
60994	64840	I mean, his lasers are fine-tuned here.
65100	67324	He's dropping it between two players every time.
67364	68005	Here's another one.
68305	71951	Nishida is just so strong, this time attacking the seam of Leal and Thales.
73834	76798	His second ace of the match and just three serves.
79428	81190	Now, Philly Blaine is saying, you carry on like that.
81210	82512	Let's have another 22 like that.
86738	88160	Well, is he going to fight with another one?
88180	90022	No, he's not.
90042	92085	That's a job done by Eugene Nishida.
92445	94929	Devastating burst of serving to open up this match.
97132	100556	Side out, we'll see Lucas Suck come back there.
100576	102759	He won this competition back in 2010.
104802	105503	Still going.
110056	114443	It's easier to say what Lucas Sackkamp hasn't had a major medal in.
114463	116507	I mean, he's got the full set.
116527	120534	His resume is extremely long and very decorated.
120754	124921	And club and international level opens up with a long serve.
124961	127305	Japan with the early jump here.
131015	135400	Not Suka serving Luccarelli, who just about deals with that.
135420	137282	That's Wallace with no real play on there.
137302	141827	A little whiff there, I think, in the middle from Onadira, and they pay for that.
141947	143689	Yohendi Leal says that's enough of that.
145931	149255	That's an attack matchup that's advantage to Brazil.
149996	156803	Leal attacking against Sekita, the smaller setter, but that time Leal goes hard cross court for the winner.
158335	162983	So Wallace, another one of these veterans with serve.
163003	163744	It's a nice take.
164025	164566	Look out.
164926	167511	Eugene Nishida absolutely rips it down there.
167531	174062	I mean, that's Thales who gets everything back in the backcourt for Brazil, but that was just too hot even for him to handle.
175004	177728	Nishida off to a brilliant start here.
178450	180934	That's his third point of the match.
189048	190890	The net serve from Aladira, side out.
197899	204647	Leal.
207731	208312	Oh, nice.
208793	209333	Nice.
209353	211576	Hey, they need a kick start.
211596	214880	Maybe Joanne Leal can provide it.
214900	218785	Well, Brazil gets an ace back this time from Leal, challenging that seam.
219305	221908	Yamamoto, we should have taken that one.
224751	227454	So Leal looking to level it up here for Brazil.
227694	233400	And he does with another ace and a completely different serve that's swirled away from Ran Takahashi.
233420	236964	Well, this is outstanding serving from Yande Leal.
237204	239146	And this is one of the hardest balls to pass.
239286	242570	Straight at you, actually going away from Ran to his line.
243671	246855	Line to line serve from Leal for another ace.
246875	249177	It's been a while since we've had a hat trick of aces.
250945	252066	And we're going to have to wait again.
252947	257533	It's a much better take from Ran Takahashi who comes up with third touch as well.
257573	261357	And it's a perfect one right at the feet of the back row defender.
261557	266864	Great pass leads to great in-system offense and Ran Takahashi attacking against Fernando.
267324	269126	That's advantage Japan all match long.
272030	273511	Masahiro Sakita, the setter.
274713	276615	Oh, he's found a nice.
278924	283070	I mean, Sakita's not known for his devastating serving, but sometimes it's about placement.
283410	290059	It doesn't have the power that Nishida has, but the placement is equally as effective through the seam and deep into the court.
292362	294325	The ace is coming thick and fast in this match.
295186	297710	Fernando goes for the quick inside second.
297750	300053	That's Flavio flying high there.
300073	301895	Flavio, which is so athletic.
302376	304299	Works hard to get around, Fernando.
305580	307463	Running that drift pattern.
308455	314924	floats away from the center and opens up that wrist away angle for the point.
314944	318228	Zekita with the forward inside set, that doesn't work.
318288	329383	So we'll have another go here with Yamauchi and they contain that Brazil and now they look to transition with Luccarelli ripping it off the block and Brazil starting to go through the gears here now after that slow start.
330663	333667	Now the Brazilian squad has to get momentum behind them, right?
333687	340276	Nishita started this match out with some quality serving, but Luca Raleigh getting a chance to get activated in the front row.
340536	342879	Scores on that first attack.
342899	344541	Flavio stays on serve.
344561	345062	No, he doesn't.
345122	345562	Side out.
345943	347485	Sends that on a little bit too deep.
347505	350829	Both teams have been very, very aggressive with their serves, which you like to see.
352491	355335	But it means you will get some deep long serves.
355355	356457	You'll get some net serves.
356537	359060	Here is Iran, Takahashi.
359080	360602	21 in a few days time.
362759	363921	full of youthful energy.
364342	366647	Again, it's a really nice pick up on Luca Rally.
367128	370174	Full of energy at 30 years old as well.
370194	373841	Part of the Olympic gold medal winning score for Brazil.
373861	374923	That'll be a fun matchup.
375264	380174	Luca Rally hitting against Nishita and vice versa, obviously.
380194	382438	Luca Rally winning that first challenge.
388038	392845	Fernando plays his club volleyball in Italy for Monza with serve.
392865	400655	That's picked up off the floor and that'll go out to Nishida who tries a little bit of finesse and the block was there to contain it and goes for a big power swing instead this time.
400675	402278	And again, Talis can't deal with it.
402298	405402	That's two that Nishida has zipped past the Brazil libero.
405762	407124	Now Luca's got stuck at the net.
407144	408066	It's the only blocker.
408126	413092	Nishida sees the alley and flushes that ball off the libero.
416958	417859	Here a Yamauchi.
423965	425166	It's picked up by Thales.
426688	430252	And the lovely angle taken there on the crosscourt from Luca Relli.
430272	436859	Now, Luca Relli had ankle all day to attack as that Suka drifted past the antenna on this move.
438021	439923	Luca Relli knows exactly what to do with that set.
450635	452757	Oh, my goodness, what a pick up that was.
453530	475082	So that's going to be collected by Luccarelli backcourt and hello Well, you won't see that too often Lucas are come straight into the net This opportunity there is Lucas got a great deflection On his block however the connection between him and Fernando Not firing there
477728	480341	Nishida, and it's another sizzler it really is.
480382	481688	That's sent backwards.
481728	486372	Luccarelli setting from about five metres behind the back line.
487415	488777	but they do keep it in play.
488817	491542	Now Sekita has options and he'll send it to Otsuka.
491562	493264	That doesn't come up with a winner either.
493284	494086	This could be trouble.
494887	500196	Yohan Delayal almost taking the head of Rantakashi off there, but he's kept it in play.
500216	502079	And then they come up with the winner as well.
502399	504442	That's typical Japan defense.
504462	505985	Just send everything back.
506045	512916	Yeah, great defense in the backcourt from Japan after a strong serve again from the inline.
514685	516327	Both teams working really hard.
516807	517768	Here's another dig.
518389	519330	Just back over the net.
519510	520591	Keep the rally going.
521672	523154	Lukareli has to step in and set.
523294	525777	And it's a block that catches Wallace on the way out.
530862	532223	That's a big bonus for Japan.
538930	539391	Nishida.
539711	541053	No.
541073	542754	Brazil, very happy to see that one go long.
542774	543375	Yeah, they are.
544992	548335	Deep Saira leave, saying that she'd have missed that serve.
552359	555642	Lucas at 10-11.
560146	571557	Sekid has to scramble around and Otsuka has done really well because the three-man block had all data get set there and bad things could have happened but Tatsunori Otsuka rubbed it off the block an hour.
572617	594338	Japan escaping this one a great serve from Lucas to the corner and then a really well-formed three-man block, but Japan gets the side out Another really good serve Talies has to hoist that one up there and Luke Carelli Can't get a winner, but Yamamoto setting from behind his baseline and somehow that's been shoveled over goodness only knows how
595415	597519	Yoendilay, I can't find a winner, Sekita.
597919	600484	As they go back in the system and did that catch the line?
600504	601546	No, it did not.
601586	603068	Otsuka goes too long.
603108	606173	That's a missed opportunity, Japan.
606374	607075	Yeah, it certainly is.
608357	611022	Otsuka just misses the contact.
611923	619336	Trying for the corner, but it was just long.
619356	619937	Wallace.
630970	647993	He's put a little bit too much under that one as well.
648033	650256	That really caught a thermal on the way over the net, didn't it?
650296	651738	A bit of a tail in on that one.
652339	653721	Pushed it way out of bounds.
661497	668508	Uandy Leal, the Cuban born outside hitter, zings that one too deep and we're getting a rash of service errors now.
669991	673697	Part of the reason for that is both these sides know you can't play safe at this level.
674378	675259	You've got to do something.
675279	678484	The borrow was set early on with two aces.
679686	680808	And a response from Brazil.
680828	682611	Now the service pressure continues.
683198	688690	Sakita's serve is picked up by Leal, Fernando has to scramble around and that allowed the block to get set.
688710	692198	And you know what, that might have been Ran Takahashi getting the final touch on that one.
692659	696988	That's a real bonus for Japan if Ran is getting block points.
699095	700076	That is him as well.
700376	703299	This ball has got to get covered by either Flavio or Lael.
703319	705341	They're both standing there, watching it hit the floor.
706462	708544	Hey, hey, let's get together here.
708965	711047	Hey, let's get together here.
711067	714691	The first thing is to hit two of them.
714711	717313	To the miss, don't let go of the line.
717333	718675	She can't let you go out, okay?
718815	720737	To the left, on top of the line.
720757	721898	He's marking the hand for him.
721978	723279	It's a good marking.
723559	724040	Keep it there.
724480	724721	Okay?
724741	725421	Get out of there.
725582	727143	I'm going to close the Miolo of the block.
727443	729085	Leave the risk for them.
729065	740839	Well, here's what's happened in the last 10 points.
741419	743362	Japan have opened up a nice healthy lead again.
748067	750630	There's such an air of confidence about this Japan squad.
750650	756557	We saw it in the volleyball nations league early this year and they went to the quarter-final stage, which was their best result.
757212	760637	You know, they hosted their own Olympics, got to the quarterfinals there.
760677	763782	They're suddenly banging on the door of being a top, top contender now.
766807	769070	Ooh, did Flavio get anything on that?
769090	771033	No, he did not get a touch on the way through.
774058	777283	Well, so far the middle attackers for Brazil not finding the court.
779686	782190	Flavio trying for the hard angle, but missing wide.
786220	797074	Sekita's serve is not particularly well handled, but the down the line from Wallace is an absolutely drill that Yamamoto, who just has to send it spinning off at a crazy angle.
797214	801600	The set from Fernando and Wallace able to turn that one hard down the line.
804584	807648	So that'll set up Flavio, Brazil with points to make up here.
809851	811333	Sekita will pick that up nicely.
811752	821446	Nishida is also picked up by Wallace in the backcourt there and now Wallace can try and scuff that one over and how many touches are they going to have?
821466	830318	Bit unlucky for Japan that time it was a good block move they got some hands on that attack as well just not able to play it cleanly out of the net
837082	839385	Flavio serving Otsuka.
840527	842090	Nice from Miyamachi.
842190	845355	Good execution.
845375	846636	Well, that all started with the pass.
847458	851364	Japan hasn't been able to run their middles very much, but they got a perfect pass and system that time.
852185	853687	They score the point through the middle.
853707	855951	Brian Takahashi.
855971	860878	Well, graduated from college, went straight into the Italian League, playing for Padua.
862732	863773	Boom.
863793	865736	Joanne Leal sends that back with interest.
865756	866737	He's in Italy as well.
866757	870662	We'll be with Pierre Chinz the next season.
870682	872725	Just a perfectly timed, big attack.
872765	874727	You see both blockers jumping on Lucas.
876029	879413	Leal can take care of that one all day long.
879433	880755	So Brazil staying close here.
881135	882717	Fernando can get him a bit closer.
883658	888064	He's getting a nice pass, but an even better block from Lucas.
888820	892114	Lucas was just one of the best middle blockers in the world.
892214	893098	So experienced.
893539	894323	What a reaction.
894805	898560	Just gets his hands up and over the net and the monster block.
904666	906752	So Fernando looking to level this one up.
906772	908297	Good response, this from Brazil.
908317	910263	That's got to be good and is.
910283	912530	I tell you what, Suga's found the corner there beautifully.
912610	913934	Just clipping that baseline.
914175	916281	Yeah, Suga's had a good start to this match.
916943	919350	It's his third point here in this opening set.
920663	924488	Yeah, he's the guy that's in the starting line-up with Ishikawa on the bench, the captain.
925349	938385	We saw Ishikawa come off the bench against Kata, and I know you were talking to Coach Philippe Blaine earlier in the week, and he alluded to just the management of some niggling injuries for Ishikawa, so they're not gonna work him too hard this early in the tournament.
938405	941288	It is all about managing your players through a tournament like this.
945754	949438	So whether we see Ishikawa or not remains to be seen.
949621	952305	What he's not ready to be, obviously, is a workhorse at the moment.
952825	956150	And that means others can step up like Otsuka.
958253	959515	Yamachi with serve.
959975	960516	That's gone.
963420	967105	Now, Fernando and Lucas communicating to each other after that play.
967446	974355	Lucas asking for a little bit of a higher set, perhaps, but this time he's able to score the point.
974976	977940	Listen, if Lucas is asking for something, Lucas is going to get it.
980570	983773	drilled by Lukarelli, kept alive.
984113	987577	Nishida with a clever push, Talies with the pancake to keep it alive as well.
987597	992021	And then the cross call from you, and now is perfect.
992061	995565	The Brazil offensive, Jung and Orton is starting to go through the gears here.
996465	1001150	But what a save to keep that ball alive by the back row player for Brazil.
1001851	1006375	Tied at 18-all and Japan decides to use a timeout.
1007857	1010560	It's OK.
1012102	1014565	It will be a fight at TGM.
1014585	1020212	We don't forget nothing about the coverage, about everything ready for this.
1021214	1021274	OK?
1022696	1026360	All right, good.
1026440	1027582	Don't close, huh?
1027602	1028663	At TGM, we don't close fight.
1028683	1030405	And you keep fighting.
1030605	1031847	High and low.
1031867	1032508	OK?
1032528	1033609	All right, go.
1036653	1036733	TGM!
1039987	1041930	Philippe Blaine keeping it simple.
1043192	1044674	It's another good response from Brazil.
1044694	1047799	That's twice Japan have had a lead in this match, right at the beginning of course.
1047899	1051985	And they had a healthy looking one at the midpoint of this set.
1052045	1054809	Only to see Brazil comes charging back at them.
1059136	1060678	Let's see what Luca Relli can do here.
1069130	1070171	picked up off the floor.
1071572	1073113	Nishida is blocked out of it.
1073194	1076396	That's a wonderful one-handed dig from Ran Takahashi.
1076436	1079159	And it's just got to be pushed over there from Otsuka, who covered a lot of ground.
1079179	1082522	But him coming for another dig from Takahashi.
1082782	1085224	And then he's just blocked out of it, though, is Otsuka.
1086705	1088087	Great defense from Brazil.
1088127	1088927	They're all round.
1089027	1090909	Great defense from Japan.
1090949	1092931	Great blocking from Brazil.
1094112	1095193	Could have gotten the first one.
1095213	1098816	But Wallace comes through with a huge block this time on Otsuka.
1100247	1102310	scoring the point and finishing off that rally.
1106317	1112026	Natsuka will sit down as Ishikawa will come in.
1112046	1113589	That's probably not a surprise.
1116133	1118577	We knew we were going to see him at some point in this match, Nick.
1122657	1125240	and they go straight after the new player, as you would, of course.
1125741	1129666	You'll have a chance at swinging at this, and he just runs into the block, but there's too much on it.
1129726	1134552	The block can't control it, so Ishikawa announces his arrival onto court in style.
1139659	1147669	First swing of the match, off the bench comes in and blasting it off of Lucas' hands, and out of balance.
1149134	1151117	He's looking for it every time, using the sheet.
1151798	1153380	He's not looking at containing serves.
1153500	1155863	He's looking to put the pressure on every time.
1156003	1160729	He has the green light, as we say, to get after it as hard as he can every single time.
1163974	1167979	Lucas, 2019, with a little net skimmer from him.
1168019	1169721	Sekita sends it to Ishikawa.
1169741	1174247	That one's going to fall perfectly, perfectly for Yohande Layal.
1175037	1178762	Sometimes you need a bit of luck, and I'll tell you, you're in Leal at that on a plate.
1178963	1190039	Well, Wallace isn't going to get credit for the block, but the deflection is just as good as it goes right to Leal, and he cleans it up.
1190059	1195727	Lucas, Brazil going through the gears and put themselves in a good position here.
1195747	1200193	That was Ishikawa running into the containing block, but that's better.
1200213	1201795	Fernando would love to have that one back.
1201876	1204960	It got past the block, and I don't think Fernando was expecting that.
1206408	1208112	Oh, Fernando kind of charges in.
1211059	1212403	Catches him up high.
1213606	1217074	But a missed defensive opportunity that time.
1217094	1221164	Japan still looking for the point on serve to get him back level.
1222287	1223269	Ishikawa.
1223857	1225940	serves Leal, who handles that one perfectly.
1226020	1227742	We looked at what an angle.
1227763	1229144	What an angle he took there.
1229164	1232469	I mean, Takahashi was there to cover it, but just couldn't get a play on that at all.
1232529	1233130	It was too good.
1233571	1237276	This angle, challenging the middle, blasting it past the left hand.
1238337	1241362	An extreme angle from Leal on the left side here.
1241682	1243625	Yeah, Ranzakashi's got that cover.
1243645	1244306	He read it all the way.
1244326	1245848	You just couldn't do anything with it.
1247313	1249437	Wallace, another powerful serve.
1249457	1250459	That'll go inside.
1250560	1252063	Wallace picks that up on the dig.
1252083	1253185	Fernanda goes back side.
1253325	1256051	Long crosscourt sat there to Luca Relli.
1257513	1260039	And Fernanda, oh, just a bit out of sync there.
1260059	1260960	Will it get away with it?
1261061	1261862	Yeah, Flavio.
1262103	1263125	No, it's still going.
1265169	1268275	Well, that's Japan's scrambling defense at its best.
1268845	1274112	But in the end, it's a really clean cross-court kill from Yohande Leal that ends that rally.
1274372	1276035	Yeah, a great swing on the right side.
1276455	1281662	Some chaos throughout that play, but Leal getting stuck on the right side because they switched their blockers.
1282123	1284206	Fernando went to the left, Leal to the right.
1284246	1286509	That's why he's attacking on the right side on the counter attack.
1288872	1293418	This might just be a catch of breath time out.
1293871	1297978	So, both sides, they make pressure outside the block.
1297998	1298799	That's my king.
1298819	1302184	So, you should be ready for taking this, huh?
1302385	1311800	Hey, we tried to come to a quick, a quick, a quick pipe and open side.
1311820	1318410	Ah, because big, it was working so much.
1325208	1330075	Now Brazil's offense is starting to heat up in the later stages of the set number one now.
1331017	1334823	And the blocking of Japan has got to get a little tighter.
1335644	1337146	Not a lot of three-man blocking.
1337867	1340351	And that wing blocker comes off to play defense.
1340371	1344077	But if they're not going to block, they've got to play some solid defense behind the two-man blocker.
1355903	1357405	Well, can Japan come back from this?
1359428	1363113	First to 25, remember, with a two-point margin.
1365736	1367519	So Wallace looking to take it to set point.
1368681	1369642	That's a nice pick-up.
1371104	1373647	And there we go, game banner block.
1373667	1377793	I'll tell you, Flavio with Leal alongside him just wiping out Nishida.
1377993	1380276	Now we're going to see a challenge here come in from Japan.
1380316	1387483	That block had so much pace behind it off of Flavio, but it catches the sideline for sure.
1387503	1390487	It looks like on that replay.
1390507	1392749	But when it's set point, you might as well chuck a challenge down.
1393991	1399957	I agree with you.
1399997	1401299	That looked like it caught plenty.
1403921	1404422	Yeah.
1406731	1408594	That's one of those, what the heck challenge is, isn't it?
1408614	1410677	Well, I mean Japan has to challenge that one.
1411498	1413441	It's a good challenge at this stage of the set.
1418288	1418869	Set point then.
1420511	1423195	Wallace looking to serve it out, that slow start from Brazil.
1423456	1428042	A distant memory here, side out, but Japan will need three points on their own serve.
1428563	1431287	They'll switch it up and bring in Kento Miyada.
1438979	1442324	There's a precious situation for Miara.
1442945	1443506	Off the bench.
1443966	1445168	Come on, save three set points.
1450676	1452839	It's a decent effort with the first one.
1452859	1456865	Somehow, Lucarelli's got under it along with Thales, and he's well off net there, Yoandilay.
1456885	1459368	And still finds a clean winner.
1459429	1462874	I mean, Brazil just powering their way through that set the longer it went on.
1463074	1468041	And from a slow start, Brazil started to crank it up, and once they did,
1468021	1472185	Covered that second lead that Japan had they, but they won that set pulling away.
1472246	1475970	Yeah, they found themselves down by three points twice in this opener.
1475990	1495851	But once they regained the lead, it didn't give it up and lay out with a huge swing here to finish off set number one high off the hands.
1497586	1498827	That's as sweet as you like.
1498867	1501130	And Renan Dalzotto says, that's how we do it.
1501170	1502091	That's how we roll.
1505615	1508198	So a slow star, but a very strong finish.
1508459	1510261	Brazil securing the first set.
1510281	1511803	25 to 21.
1511923	1517810	And this is how they did it by the numbers.
1518010	1521594	Three to two blocks, five aces with three going to Japan.
1522375	1526800	The attack points very heavily favoring Brazil.
1529378	1534046	Great block in defense and great serving in that opener.
1535228	1538573	Setting the table for what was expected to be a very exciting match, Nick.
1538633	1542720	And can't really complain about that first set from both sides.
1542780	1555521	Good quality volleyball all the way around.
1560074	1561576	So placement for Brazil.
1563540	1564541	Looking like this.
1564561	1577543	A little more heavy to that left side of the court going after that front row outside hitter that's got to pass.
1591765	1599577	And for Japan, looking like this.
1603102	1618465	Once the big hitter's got into that stride, Wallace and Leal, in particular, Lukarelli.
1620638	1625483	Throw in a couple of blocks, and the Brazil juggernaut.
1625503	1634113	After a couple, a little bit of a shaky start for Brazil, they found themselves, Leal scoring nine points in that opening set.
1634213	1639899	Nishita with two aces right at the start of the set, didn't contribute, wasn't able to contribute very much after that.
1641081	1645525	Now only two attack points for Nishita through set one, two service ace points.
1648148	1649650	Defensively they did a number on him,
1651840	1654967	Whenever Nishida did try to attack, there's always a two-man block.
1654987	1656130	He didn't get any one-on-ones.
1664128	1665351	That was an exciting opener.
1665712	1669140	Let's hope set number two is equally as exciting here.
1684628	1689113	It'll be Fernando to get this second set underway.
1692837	1696260	Yamamoto picks that up, then Mishita can't get the better of Thales.
1696861	1697842	Backside it goes.
1698663	1703028	Neat, neat as you like for Wallace DeSousa, dropping into the feet of the back row defender there.
1703809	1707793	Wallace is just so deceptive on his attacking from the right side.
1707893	1712678	Faces angle, but has that whip of an arm that can turn it right back down the line.
1717163	1719567	Fernando does bring a bit of spite to his serves.
1721029	1725556	She takes everything off that one, so Keita can go back side and the Sheeter again is blocked out of it.
1726077	1731185	So it's scramble time for Japan and they almost scrambled something rather good out of that from Ishikawa.
1732988	1733488	Oh dear.
1734730	1735652	That's a big miss.
1736072	1737435	That's a really big miss.
1737455	1739678	Taishi Onodira won't want to see a replay of this.
1740957	1744326	Now, Brazil not happy with that no call on that third ball over.
1744387	1746412	That was clearly a double contact.
1746492	1747094	Great effort.
1748458	1755979	This is the contact that they're not happy with, but an attack through the middle from Japan results in that hitting air.
1763536	1765598	Fernando drills it.
1765618	1766599	It's another strong serve.
1766619	1768080	He's mixing up his serves really well.
1768100	1771224	Ishikawa picked it up, but his third touch wasn't particularly devastating.
1771244	1775648	And the block, I tell you, Taishi Onodera gets some redemption there for the earlier miss.
1775988	1777470	The stuffed block, straight back.
1779492	1781514	Lugarelli couldn't get it past the block this time.
1782274	1787299	A nice move by Japan, and the left hand there, shutting it down for the monster block.
1787379	1788200	Well over the net.
1789161	1792024	Perfectly executed block move there from the middle.
1793185	1793766	Nishida.
1796932	1798375	Oh, that's not a great take at all.
1798896	1800098	Somehow that's been rescued.
1800799	1806690	Tough to get a winner from there, but they are still trying to put something aggressive on it, and then Nishida does finish the job.
1807191	1808974	It all went wrong on service reception there.
1809014	1814164	Anytime it goes careering off in the direction of your coach and the bench, it's not good.
1820894	1822837	So Ishida restoring parity.
1823778	1825460	2-2, set two.
1830167	1832250	Oh, I tell you, that's another huge swing.
1833451	1835094	Somehow, they all got enough underneath it.
1835815	1836796	Wallace just has to shut.
1836816	1837837	Oh, that's a bonus.
1837857	1838859	What a bonus that is.
1838879	1842824	I tell you, Sakita and Ishikawa are not happy about something here.
1843645	1850715	Now the horn went off right after the serve was hit.
1850965	1853568	Bit of a mystery buzzer going off.
1860376	1870327	Yeah, it doesn't help anybody, does it?
1870347	1872950	I mean, it's the old cliche, this hands-off you play to the whistle.
1872990	1875893	Well, that was the equivalent of the whistle.
1879501	1882231	Now coach Felipe Lane has a legitimate argument.
1884018	1885905	He wants a replay, but he's not going to get it.
1887451	1887591	Nope.
1887812	1888615	The point stands.
1889177	1890422	It is 3-2 Brazil.
1893085	1898073	Luccarelli with a hot one around Takahashi, picks it up nicely, Nishida rips through.
1898994	1901739	Somehow that has gone into the net and Leal's recovered.
1901919	1905885	Oh my goodness, Luccarelli with the swing of the match so far.
1906226	1908649	That looked like a dead ball completely.
1908669	1913036	Somehow they've reacted and what a way to finish the rally from Luccarelli.
1916241	1917563	That's off the charts, good.
1918565	1919346	What a play.
1927375	1928236	Lukareli again.
1928917	1930299	Slappy angle served there.
1930559	1933343	Yamamoto has done well to pick up, and the blocks worked out.
1933423	1937308	Once again, Lukas celebrates sending that one back.
1937368	1939611	Lukas and Wall is pairing up nicely that time.
1939691	1947562	And Japan just can't find the rhythm with their left side attacker.
1949184	1955813	Forced them to call a timeout here early and set to.
1956974	1957736	Something was good.
1959702	1962850	Remember, when the opponent is playing good, go slowly.
1962870	1964655	Keep the ball a little bit higher.
1965157	1971895	Keep it stronger, high, long, and you can cover, and you can keep the ball working.
1972077	1980967	He knows these players very well.
1981367	1986032	He was the assistant to Yuiichi Nakagaiichi for four years.
1986092	1990017	He's been there for a number of years.
1995202	1998726	When Nakagaiichi decided to call it a career and retire,
1999263	2007494	And Philippe Blaine was the obvious upgrade in terms of just moving him up from the staff to the head job for the Japan Federation.
2008515	2017787	Sekita has to travel there, and Ishikawa doesn't really get a great touch on him, but it was enough sneaky stuff there to get the better of the block.
2017807	2022874	Yeah, Brazil working hard to get three blockers up after that great serve from Lukarelli, but...
2023647	2026370	Japan a bit lucky on that one to go off the block and down.
2026570	2029233	Yeah, hopefully Blaine's face told the story.
2029493	2031095	Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.
2033217	2033878	Ishikawa.
2035159	2036681	Whoa, close, close.
2038543	2040925	Look long.
2040945	2041766	But not very long.
2041986	2044269	Not very long and nearly a touch of a layout.
2050355	2052237	Lucas at 6-3 Brazil.
2055085	2057288	Ishikawa with a lovely pass.
2059051	2067863	Really well kept up there by Lucas off the block and away, but they'll scramble this back somehow, hoisted up there by Sekita, free ball Brazil.
2067963	2068984	Where are they going to go with it?
2069425	2070086	A far side.
2070326	2071047	Thank you very much.
2071127	2073070	See you later, says Wallace de Souza.
2073090	2077296	Yeah, Wallace going with that fast set inside.
2077596	2080941	Look at that contact point, well over the block and down.
2084313	2085295	Bruno says golf clap.
2086838	2087319	He approves.
2088301	2090224	If he approves, it must have been good.
2093150	2095514	Lucas drilling it at Ram Takahashi.
2095594	2096636	His pass is terrific.
2097257	2099642	And he gets the benefit of third touch as well.
2099682	2102828	Lovely pass there from Ram Takahashi.
2112190	2126453	Ran just gets the one-on-one against Wallace Japan still got some damage to repair here on Adera Up next
2130061	2133246	Another big power for Swing through there from Yo-Ni-Le-Ao.
2133266	2135288	Sekita's had to cover an awful lot of ground there.
2135369	2137752	And that's a really nice take.
2137772	2139855	Ran Takahashi off the block and away.
2140416	2142559	But Sekita's getting all the credit for that.
2142599	2144942	The ground he covered there to make that set.
2145163	2146264	And the bump set too.
2147045	2149829	That Ron can attack high off the hands and score.
2149849	2158161	They needed that point in Japan.
2159980	2161482	back within touching distance here.
2161923	2163766	Onadera will stay on serve.
2164627	2168534	Fernando sends it near side and Yondele Al just rips that crosscourt.
2168634	2171859	Just nothing that Ishikawa could do about that.
2172660	2178089	Leal against Seketa and Leal will win that challenge every single time.
2179932	2181955	So much speed behind that attack.
2190524	2192026	Wallace finds nothing but Nylon.
2203120	2205363	So that'll be Sekita back to the service line.
2210850	2213233	Did find an ace earlier, but that one's not going to be an ace.
2213914	2214855	That's going to be Iced.
2215476	2216177	Wallace.
2220865	2223768	Wallace comes right back with a huge swing out of the back row.
2224909	2226510	So much line for him to attack.
2227871	2229553	Takes advantage of it.
2229573	2231295	Well, that's an illustration of what we talked about, Matt.
2231315	2234237	At this level, if you serve, it doesn't put any pressure on the opponent.
2234498	2235298	That's what's going to happen.
2235318	2237120	There's a serve that put pressure on the opponent.
2237140	2239302	The overpass ruthlessly punished by Luccarelli.
2245268	2246909	And Brazil just panning their lead here.
2248250	2250012	And Yamamoto sending it back.
2250768	2252051	Look really so.
2252071	2252532	We don't want it.
2253375	2257284	Get rid of that.
2257304	2262718	So Lael will serve into the net.
2281396	2282998	Tales picks that one up.
2283018	2284139	Fernando covers some ground.
2284199	2285581	Lucarelli with the clever push.
2285601	2287103	Yamamoto does manage to get there.
2287143	2289866	Rishi Kaur at the three meter line is wiped out.
2290307	2295152	Absolutely blown away there by Flavio, who had a long time to get himself set there.
2295393	2296914	You take it from that deep off the net.
2297435	2298677	You're asking for trouble.
2298697	2302902	Yeah, Flavio doing a great job to get his hands over and in front of the hitter.
2304223	2308348	Strong left hand there from a very veteran blocker in Flavio.
2311349	2316416	who will now go to the service line and flirted with the foot fault there.
2316516	2323747	But the overpass as Japan's receiving is just not at the highest level at the moment in this second set.
2323767	2325129	That's two or three overpass.
2325209	2326911	I think we've seen now from them in this set.
2329075	2331518	And that is usually what is going to happen if you overpass.
2332510	2333832	So Flavio will stay on.
2335214	2336797	Yamamoto picks that one up.
2337979	2339641	Lovely defensive work from Flavio.
2341124	2343527	And then a big swing, but nothing doing for Wallace.
2343567	2344489	It's come back somehow.
2344569	2348335	So Luca Relli goes for a little bit of touch and finishes the job.
2348355	2351800	So Keita was stranded mid-court, trying to get there and couldn't.
2351820	2354705	Look at all these hitters coming from Brazil.
2355506	2356568	Three hitters lay out.
2356628	2357910	Lucas, Luca Relli.
2358785	2359747	Manly the outside hitter.
2360368	2362551	Places it gently to the floor for the point.
2374270	2376653	Just floated down a little bit long, Flavio.
2376674	2385147	But overall, Matt, you know, we're only a second and a half in, but, you know, we were talking about that little bit of that invincibility thing, maybe not there for Brazil.
2385498	2389302	They breezed their way through a very good Japan team through a set and a half here.
2389502	2390864	They're looking very strong right now.
2390884	2391665	Really strong.
2393627	2396410	Yamauchi serves Leal.
2396991	2398512	He doesn't handle it particularly well.
2399834	2401716	But they get something out of it thanks to Wallace.
2405140	2410486	You think if you've got Luca Relli setting off court, you've got a chance if you're the defending team.
2410806	2413009	But Wallace didn't give them that chance.
2413609	2414290	So Fernando.
2415502	2416784	We'll now serve at 14-8.
2416964	2419488	Sends a short one in.
2419829	2420790	Nadira picks that up.
2421391	2423314	And that's more like it from Eugene Nishida.
2423354	2431547	The big left-handed swing near side this time off Lucarelli and Lucas.
2431567	2436595	Now Nishida, that's his first attack point of this set.
2436935	2440581	Japan needs him to score for their side.
2441675	2446100	Well, after that explosive start when he went off like a bottle of champagne, they just had the court taken out of it.
2446140	2450925	I mean, you know, they've given him nothing, Brazil, until that moment there.
2451086	2459014	Yeah.
2459034	2459935	It's run on a big one.
2460857	2471108	Too big.
2479660	2481211	Ran Takahashi picks that up.
2481231	2482258	Sekita has to travel.
2482822	2484473	Ishikawa runs into the block.
2484925	2488369	The block's there again as Ishikawa is off net this time.
2489010	2491092	And Lukarelli comes up to set.
2491112	2492774	Wallace tries to go cross-court.
2493034	2495317	Sekita will now send a cross-court for Ishikawa.
2495417	2496878	There's the block, but out it goes.
2496898	2498780	They got three in the block.
2498800	2502164	But Ishikawa, the captain, still managed to conjure up a winner.
2502925	2506109	Yeah, great set, that time from Sekita all the way out.
2506209	2513717	And three blockers, Leal, the last one to get there results in that attack going off his hands and then out of bounds.
2513697	2516060	And Ishida and Sekita check out here.
2518384	2519966	Japan look to try and mix things up.
2520907	2523551	Sending out Masaki Oya, the back-up center.
2523591	2527256	And Kento Miyara, the young opposite.
2530421	2531122	Ishikawa.
2532183	2533065	That's a clever serve.
2534446	2537511	But once Lukarelli got underneath, or Leal got underneath it, should I say.
2538412	2541156	It was one, two, three, finished by Lukas.
2544308	2548615	Just an absolutely beautiful angle that time from Lucas on that 31 set.
2580792	2583075	on Adira.
2583095	2584557	Really soft serve that one.
2584918	2586159	Wallace is blocked out.
2587521	2589784	Yamauchi got over there.
2589804	2590485	No, no, no.
2591346	2592308	You're not having that one.
2593129	2594631	Now Japan can celebrate that one.
2594671	2597355	One of their few blocks they've gotten in this match so far.
2597395	2601400	Right hand of Ron getting that block point.
2605750	2606391	Onodera.
2607672	2608633	Sneaky little serve.
2608653	2609915	Fernando brings it near side.
2609955	2611016	Leal down the line.
2611156	2612137	Doesn't get a winner.
2612258	2613719	Oya was there to pick that up.
2613739	2615501	There's a cross call picked up by Thales.
2615842	2618965	Fernando sends it inside another brilliant dig by Oya.
2619886	2620827	And that's going to come over.
2620867	2623971	And Fernando will set up Leal again.
2624011	2625353	And he still can't get a winner.
2625433	2626794	Oya with another one.
2627015	2627936	I tell you something.
2628016	2631560	Masaki Oya with three digs on that point.
2632120	2634323	And that's outstanding defensive work.
2636733	2637294	There it is.
2637354	2642440	Great pick up, but Ishikawa then hammering this ball on two.
2643821	2644943	Lavio made a good read.
2647345	2648507	What an effort from Japan.
2649228	2657998	Yeah, Ishikawa gets the credit for the kill point, obviously, but Oya dig off to dig off to dig, and now Brazil is saying, oh, we want to stop this little charge.
2661337	2686819	Renan's out, Dalzotto.
2688161	2691023	Sensing the momentum swing there.
2691577	2696122	The old story isn't that, when you come off the bench you always want to make a mark.
2696182	2700826	Let people know you're around and Masaki Oya certainly made an impact there on that point.
2705531	2708574	Now will that provide a spark here for Japan?
2709575	2710135	Onodera.
2713999	2716842	Serves Leial and yeah, what an angle.
2717767	2719730	Absolutely impossible to stop that.
2719750	2725157	Oh, no, Derro was there, but Flavio just so athletic, attacking this ball at such a high point.
2726619	2727681	Another angle for that swing.
2731706	2732127	Wallace.
2733709	2734931	17-13 in Brazil.
2735411	2736653	Still comfortable here.
2737088	2744123	Nice pickup by Ran Takahashi who will take that one off the block, but it'll fall nicely into the backcourt and there's another high one from Flavio.
2744163	2751077	That's some rescue for Moira, but I think he's gone the wrong side of the antenna.
2751097	2752600	Another terrific effort from him.
2761642	2766788	Well, it is a feature of Japan volleyball that always has been that everything comes back.
2767209	2769712	But even he couldn't sneak that inside the antenna.
2771254	2773797	So Wallace will now serve at 18-13.
2774878	2776180	Nice pickup.
2776200	2778182	The block was even better from Flavio.
2779204	2782067	So Ishikawa has to turn setter.
2782087	2788375	And Ran Takahashi says, thank you very much.
2791173	2793875	Flavio with a good adjustment, but just a little bit late.
2794316	2807708	Reaches to the hitter, and, gosh, he takes advantage of it.
2807728	2818918	Well, they're setting up for the block here, but in order to have a chance at the block, you've got to get yourself in play, and Miara goes too long, so it's Sekita who will return at Setter.
2820113	2821676	After getting a recharge on the bench.
2829870	2830331	Leal.
2834719	2835541	Where's that going?
2835561	2837424	Too much on it.
2837624	2840089	The overpass from Ishikawa, smashed back.
2840149	2840890	Well, hello.
2851231	2852973	That violation called against Brazil.
2853053	2854055	Flavio admits to it.
2862606	2863768	That's a let-off for Japan.
2864308	2868534	Ran at Takahashi.
2868734	2871438	With an awful lot of work to do here to get themselves back into it.
2871538	2873060	Fernando brings it near side.
2873100	2879989	Lukarelli can't get the better of Yamamoto and nor can Ishikawa get the better of Flavio.
2880897	2882458	is sent back with interest.
2886022	2891627	Lavio again patrolling the net so high against his hand so far over the net.
2892528	2894189	That's exactly what Brazil wants to see.
2900695	2902417	Well, they send young Darlan in there.
2904979	2909503	Youngster, just 20 years old, plays his club volleyball in Sao Paulo.
2910428	2911670	Sends in a beauty.
2912090	2913392	So Ishikawa's lost that.
2916617	2920303	Does that go in the record books as an ace, even though Yamamoto got a second touch?
2920323	2922165	Because if it does, it does well, but it should.
2922366	2922786	It should.
2923988	2926091	Oh, that's impact off the bench.
2926131	2929176	Darlan sends in a screamer.
2934544	2936166	You make one step, do you say?
2936416	2951635	You have to manage your high ball with this block.
2951876	2958424	What do you need to work on?
2965762	2967725	This is how the last ten points have played out.
2969987	2971489	Just padded their lead here, Brazil.
2972451	2976936	And they've comfortably got this match exactly where they want it.
2978919	2981442	And they haven't seen the last of Darlan serving either.
2983405	2989272	A big, hitting 20-year-old sent in another zinger, Yamamoto with an absolutely superb pass, Ishikawa.
2989690	2990331	Good enough.
2990571	2991512	Lucas was there.
2991933	2994936	That took plenty off that, so it didn't come screaming back there.
2994976	2997639	That's clever from Ishikawa.
2997659	2998500	That's a little touch.
3000463	3003386	Lucas just sending it out of bounds.
3003406	3007431	Side out, but Japan needing an awful lot here.
3010855	3011556	Yamachi.
3015701	3016241	Side out.
3018604	3019545	He knows where...
3020875	3022977	heading into set three with Japan two sets down.
3024218	3027162	That says an incredible meltdown here from Brazil.
3032347	3033929	Fernanda skims the net.
3033949	3039675	That's picked up by Rand Takahashi, who will now drive through straight into the block and back.
3040976	3045140	A trademark Takahashi pipe attack meets a wall of yellow.
3046942	3049785	And there's only one winner.
3051487	3053550	Lucas says, are you really bringing it here?
3053890	3054271	Really?
3054451	3055392	You taking me on?
3056214	3056995	Get out of here.
3058537	3060420	Sakita, that's the stretch.
3060440	3062543	Ishikawa stretch, does he drop it on the line?
3062583	3065006	No, he does not.
3065046	3066648	Set point, Brazil.
3072116	3073538	Just the wrong side of the line.
3078565	3081409	Fernando looking to wrap it up right here.
3082958	3083519	Can't do it.
3084620	3089706	That's Japan facing an overwhelming odds.
3091368	3092629	17-24 down.
3093130	3094832	They do have Nashida back there to serve.
3096073	3100578	He's always got an ace in him, but he needs seven devastating serves in a row.
3102260	3103902	Well, picks that one up.
3103922	3105664	Wallace wraps it up.
3106145	3106665	No, he doesn't.
3106686	3108848	That takes the net cord, not a touch.
3111157	3114242	thought at first that had taken a touch, but no, that skimmed off the net cord.
3114483	3115985	So they fight one off here, Japan.
3121415	3124179	Nishida though overheats that one, and that'll do it.
3125942	3128867	Brazil, dominant performance in that second set.
3129749	3135679	Not letting Japan get a sniff, grabbed the initiative early and never let their opponents get anywhere near them.
3136418	3140965	And it's a long trudge back to the sidelines for Japan.
3140985	3142507	They were facing a real headache here.
3142647	3147995	Brazil who trailed by two in their first match against Cuba came back to win in three.
3148496	3149938	But it's a different outlook here.
3150358	3152762	It's the Brazilians leading by two.
3153823	3161194	And it's Japan that are going to be thinking about the long comeback here because that was as comfortable as you like.
3162828	3169762	They had that slow start in set one, went through the gears here, they started fast Brazil and never let Japan get a sniff.
3171084	3177897	The numbers looking like this, 12-9 attack points, the four blocks to two, the ace serve, everything really stacking up in Brazil's favour.
3179761	3183027	And all those numbers point to the same outcome.
3183048	3184330	It's a comfortable
3184900	3186582	set for Brazil.
3187102	3191847	And Renan Dalzotto, who I think we will hear from momentarily, must be pretty happy with what he's seen.
3191867	3195971	Although coaches rarely are, of course, they're always seeking perfection.
3201617	3204399	With Brazil's head coach, Dalzotto, thank you for joining us.
3204439	3206562	Your team is up, two sets to zero.
3206722	3208724	Early pressure from Japan, but you've answered.
3209164	3211026	What's your message to the team going forward?
3211310	3219179	It's a very balanced match, because Japan is always strong in Batuta, like the first seven.
3219199	3220741	We made the difference in Batuta.
3221441	3235157	We had the tranquility to support Rebeni, the attitude, knowing how to play with a high ball, but the smell is very good in defense, so this third set is very important to have the right mind to start Rebeni.
3235964	3236686	Thank you very much.
3236706	3243622	Good luck the rest of the way.
3243662	3246148	Very strong from Brazil.
3247671	3251120	They are not taking any chances at all.
3251801	3254327	It did look like the possibility that they might be
3254729	3256191	stretched here by Japan.
3256311	3266287	It hasn't worked out that way at all and it'll be very interesting to hear what Philippe Blaine, the Japan head coach, makes of that first two sets and what he might be able to do to turn it around.
3271876	3275501	With Japan head coach Philippe Blaine, Philippe, down 0-2.
3275762	3278526	What are you telling your team now to start set number three in this match?
3278962	3283827	I want to be speaking with my team right now, so I will go to speak with them.
3283847	3286550	So, yeah, Brazil is being good, serving good.
3286851	3289553	The defense much better at the beginning of the match than usual.
3290094	3299224	So, now we have to find a side out to a more efficient, to have a chance to come back into the games and to try to make our defense more offensive.
3299604	3305471	Thank you for the time, Coach.
3305491	3306792	So, look at the spike velocity.
3355844	3365436	The numbers for Uando Leal, who's been a silver medal winner in the world championship back in the day with his native Cuba, a naturalised Brazilian, of course.
3370743	3383860	Ishikawa off the bench has come in and contributed seven attack points, but it's the Japan attack that has really been blunted through these first two sets and rare for Philippe Blaine,
3384717	3389921	to not have an awful lot to say there, but what can you say after Brazil's performance?
3389941	3397768	A little bit more to say than maybe he wanted, but he wanted to get back to his team and prepare them to start set number three.
3399430	3400390	He's got to find that magic.
3400851	3413762	Whatever they had in the beginning of set number one, to get out to that early 3-0 lead, those two three-point leads that they had in set number one, it's kind of escaped them, but Brazil really found themselves in every aspect of the game.
3414316	3415998	and has been playing very strong ever since.
3425146	3427328	They have been whispers around the world of volleyball.
3427348	3428989	I mean, it's not just you and me, Matt.
3429029	3441541	There's a little whiff of Brazil, perhaps not being where they once were after that quarterfinal exit in the volleyball nation's league and the Japan on the upswing, but this doesn't look like a meeting of one team on the way up and one team on the way down to me.
3441561	3442382	No, it certainly doesn't.
3442482	3443783	I mean, Brazil has responded.
3444488	3449996	And especially after being down two games to Nunn, to Cuba, and coming back to win the next three.
3451198	3452099	To a good position here.
3452260	3453722	Yeah, that really has given them a jolt.
3453802	3458309	Four sets they've won in a row, and they'll be well on course for five here, you would think.
3459050	3461273	Fernando gets them back in system.
3461293	3465319	Again, defensively really good from Rantaka, Hashid Nishida.
3465339	3467302	No, that's going to go out.
3467322	3471829	Well, if they can get their outside hitters firing, they've got a chance.
3474745	3477329	They need Nishida, we've been saying it all match long.
3477389	3480194	He had a great start, was very quiet in set number two.
3480855	3485663	But that could be a good sign, especially the sign that Japan needs here in set three.
3492554	3495158	Haven't seen much of a big old Felipe Roque so far.
3498424	3499926	Number 21 for Brazil.
3500716	3503239	Oh, nice fake, but they don't buy the fake.
3503259	3506562	That's good defending from Japan, and they're going to need to do some more though, and they can't get it.
3507383	3507903	Can't get it.
3513209	3514490	Lucas just so long.
3514970	3516552	Look where Fernando set that ball from.
3517253	3520456	All in the way, nearly at the sideline.
3520476	3521657	What is it about?
3521777	3522618	What is it about Lucas?
3522658	3526762	Everyone keeps saying, well, he's going to start to, his skills will start to erode at some point.
3526782	3527443	He's 36.
3527683	3529525	There's no sign of it at all.
3532340	3540048	Yeah, Nishida gets the better there of Leal, who didn't really have much of an opportunity to do much about that.
3540949	3544793	Leal so far inside to start that block move, and then he goes wide like that.
3546675	3547896	Takes one right off the forehead.
3551520	3554684	Nishida drills it, it's another nice ace.
3555164	3555985	Perfect.
3558952	3562055	And Nishida off to a very hot start here in set number three.
3562415	3564057	Two kills and a service ace.
3568361	3571544	Yesotales just look at that and say, ah, no, he's got another one.
3575287	3577749	And they do come in bunches with Eugene Nishida.
3579491	3580672	He won't hold back on this one.
3581132	3581693	Drilled it.
3581893	3582934	Really nice pick up that.
3584095	3586157	The crosscourt from Wallace doesn't work.
3587504	3594091	And Chicago goes for a bit of finesse, a bit of football from Fernando, but no.
3594111	3595273	They're not going to let him have that.
3595393	3597355	Got to appreciate the effort there from Fernando.
3598717	3604924	Got the ball up on that first contact, but watch it go straight into Wallace's chest that has to go over.
3604964	3609329	Fernando's got to work on his football skills a little bit.
3609349	3611731	Listen, if you're Brazilian, you know how to use your feet.
3611792	3613073	That's a given.
3619398	3621083	They made a fast start in set one.
3621585	3622267	Got picked back.
3624393	3625737	What Brazil need is a side out.
3625958	3628044	Get this guy out of the service rotation.
3628445	3629408	Get him out of there.
3631210	3632212	Tales picks that up.
3632252	3633374	It's a really nice pass.
3633394	3637421	Fernando goes back side with the set and Wallace finishes the job.
3637441	3640566	Really, really good pass from Tales.
3640646	3641989	Oh, it was an amazing pass.
3642209	3650383	And then this swing from Wallace just placing it precisely right down the line for that point in a much needed side out for Brazil.
3666800	3673388	Lucas as that sent back and then it's taken off the block and away in Japan, resolutely trying to dig in here.
3674650	3678855	All smiles from Sekita as Onodara takes care of business here.
3689848	3690529	Ishikawa.
3708903	3710004	Wallace de Souza.
3715071	3716293	Nice, the angle served there.
3717154	3719457	Ryan Takahashi runs into the block.
3719477	3720519	He'll have another go here.
3720559	3722021	The containing block is there.
3722061	3724404	He gets the better of it, but Wallace is there to keep it alive.
3724424	3726767	Luka Relly sets it up and lay it off.
3726787	3729350	Takes it off and Ishida's attempted dig.
3729370	3732835	Ishida in retrospect, maybe should have left that alone, but...
3733405	3735908	It's his touch, sends it out, and they back come Brazil.
3736569	3742596	Wallace doing a great job to keep this ball alive in the set from Luccarelli to his teammate.
3745439	3746901	They all get that point.
3746921	3748703	Pretty sure that was dropping in there anyway.
3748843	3750145	He had to try and make a play at it.
3754110	3755211	Wallace.
3755832	3759460	down the line to Takahashi Nishida is wiped out.
3759540	3760803	Absolutely wiped out.
3760823	3761725	Was that Flavio?
3761785	3762948	Was it Luccarelli?
3762968	3763910	Brazil don't care.
3764150	3765633	They'll take another stuff block.
3767518	3768881	Leal with the right hand.
3769682	3772288	Keeping it over just long enough to get that block point.
3778867	3781791	It's going to take blocks now for Brazil.
3784054	3785156	I think he's put too much on that.
3785656	3788240	Yeah, around Takahashi.
3788260	3789181	Sends that too deep.
3792205	3806325	Well, they've made the strong start, but they've been overhauled by Brazil already here in Japan.
3811537	3814561	We have to find solution of it, huh?
3814581	3814942	Okay?
3816063	3819028	Sometime or so, using push or, huh?
3819528	3822633	You can use many things, working with, huh?
3822653	3823775	There you go.
3823795	3826078	But we don't forget fight, also.
3826158	3838776	We don't play so much, so we can go, we can go, but we don't fight.
3853775	3854596	Off the timeout.
3855056	3857038	Here comes Wallace, Brazil 6-5.
3859040	3860101	Serving Yamamoto.
3860902	3863124	Sent back side, Nishida takes it off the block.
3864906	3867569	Side out.
3867589	3870672	Lael knows he's very close to getting a block on Nishida.
3871213	3875257	But you can see him reach back in and Nishida just targets the forearm and goes out of bounds.
3878380	3879281	As you say, he knows.
3879341	3881263	That's a couple of inches.
3881923	3883545	And he's got himself another block point.
3884993	3887016	Fine margins, always is in this game.
3888898	3894065	That's a pretty soft serve coming in from Onadira, who's got underneath that somehow, that is some rescue.
3896027	3899872	And then nothing doing there for Takahashi, who's denied at the baseline, and then a block.
3900433	3907542	Oh, it's gone out, it's spun away from Yamachi, thought he'd got himself a block point there, and it just took that wicked spin off court.
3908230	3913576	Leal scoring his 13th point of the match and he is not showing any signs of slowing down.
3914277	3918923	Taking swing after swing, scoring points for his side.
3927152	3932078	Leal, some of a zinger, nicely collected, Brian Takahashi.
3932817	3935844	No winner for him, but always kind of swing at that.
3935924	3936565	Would you believe it?
3936766	3938470	You know, Andy Leal from a mile back.
3939432	3941296	And now Brazil will look to transition.
3941657	3942819	Set it up on the inside.
3943020	3945104	Brilliant from Ishikawa back.
3945124	3946327	He can't keep it in play.
3946588	3947670	And they're just being...
3948528	3949950	Overworked here, Japan.
3950091	3954799	I mean, so strong defensively, but Brazil just keeps sending the heavy hitters out there, Adam.
3954819	3959266	Well, Leal wanted that one and Fernando knows who the hot hitter is.
3960068	3961110	He's setting Leal.
3961410	3973050	No matter where he is on the court, he's taking a swing at it.
3983408	3989619	That's a tough one for Sekita to deal with, yeah.
3989639	3990461	We'll do this one again.
3996031	4000258	That's good to see the referee taking responsibility of that.
4000619	4003003	I'm sorry guys, can we do this one again please?
4003287	4008985	bit quick on the whistle, wanted to call the double, but realized that Lukarelli was playing it back to his own side.
4009908	4011473	Players don't mind that.
4012135	4013098	Everybody makes a mistake.
4014081	4017111	He put his hands up, said, yeah, that's on me, and everyone's just going to get on with it.
4035333	4038182	Leal at 86 into the net.
4043618	4046727	Just trying to stick around here, Japan, and service errors will help.
4058823	4061267	Tales with a perfect service reception.
4061387	4062850	No winner there though for Flavio.
4062870	4065154	This time they've contained that in comes Ishikawa.
4065174	4066115	Does he catch the line?
4066135	4068279	And the answer to that is no, he does not.
4070282	4072666	Well, Ishikawa missed that opportunity.
4072706	4078296	Flavio reaches to the right side and Ishikawa misses to the wrist away.
4079838	4080600	You're playing Brazil.
4080640	4082603	Those are the kind of shots you've got to have.
4084405	4090813	Flavio serving Yamamoto, an easy take for him and an easy put away for Yamachi, uncontested.
4102929	4107915	Japan not utilizing their middles a lot in this match so it's good to see them get a point here and there.
4112688	4116171	Again, really nice pick up there from Lukarelli, who will get third touch on this.
4116311	4118793	Ooh, did that take anything on the way through?
4118833	4121996	They're saying no, and immediately Lukas is saying, you challenged that.
4122276	4123758	Lukas had big eyes on that.
4125359	4128882	Yeah, as soon as the challenge came in, Japan admitted to the touch.
4132445	4138971	We'll see the replay here, but right there off the pinky.
4138991	4141193	Yeah, Yamachi saying, yeah, that's on me.
4143755	4146739	Fernando.
4146759	4150565	10-8 Brazil.
4151166	4153089	He's mixing his serves up.
4153109	4154811	Sakita sends it over to Ishikawa.
4154852	4156754	That's picked up by Fernando down the line.
4156794	4159078	This will be Luccarelli looking at this one.
4159138	4160620	And I think he's overheated that one.
4160640	4161401	That goes wide.
4167070	4169914	Luccarelli just missing the sideline there as well.
4173387	4178371	There's just enough misses and service errors from Brazil to keep Japan within touching distance here.
4181534	4185718	But then Yamachi has got to make sure his serves go in, especially when it's as soft as that.
4187500	4189502	And he doesn't need anyone to tell him that.
4197909	4199410	Lukarelli then, 11-9.
4199571	4200752	Got to be side out Japan.
4201012	4202213	Just got to dig in here.
4203138	4204640	Stay close, Sekita under.
4204780	4208184	Intense pressure feeds Nishida and that won't drop their weight.
4209425	4210666	Well, it was all service reception.
4210726	4212128	The pass was not perfect.
4212148	4218495	Sekita did well just to give Nishida any kind of play at all, but the defenders were just lining up.
4218515	4222980	Yeah, Leal finally getting that one off of Nishida that he missed earlier.
4223060	4228386	And Sekita a little frustrated with this setting location there after that play was over.
4230205	4233309	Luccarelli at 12-9 Brazil.
4238236	4240459	Takahashi picking that one up.
4240479	4241721	Now, has Nishida got that?
4241861	4242762	No, he hasn't.
4242782	4243483	He hasn't.
4244765	4249331	I think this match has just gone away from Japan, just in these last two points.
4249371	4250432	Just a little off the net.
4250492	4253617	Nishida trying to make something of it, but just misses the inline.
4255359	4256240	Nishida out.
4256941	4259925	Kento Miara in for Japan.
4266571	4270635	Lukarelli serving at 13-9, desperately needed side out here for Japan.
4270655	4271756	Two of them going for that one.
4273038	4280946	Yamamoto setting from way, way, way back and Fernando sets up the pipe attack and that is just drilled by Lukarelli.
4280966	4284690	And again, Japan in disarray on their service reception and they've paid for it.
4286392	4290216	Lukarelli just hammers that ball into that open seam.
4304219	4305881	Lukareli serving Yamamoto.
4306101	4307764	Sekita has to move around a little bit.
4307824	4316995	Miara has to take a very, very clever swing at that because the blockers were lining up to send that back and he's been very creative with his swing.
4317015	4321040	Yeah, nice off-speed shot there from the opposite that just came in.
4325346	4327489	Brunos living every point there, isn't he, on the bench?
4330372	4334057	So Miara opening his account off the bench.
4334830	4339737	That's all he's going to have for his tally after he comes up with a service error.
4339757	4341659	Brazil with such a comfortable lead here.
4357661	4358022	Clever.
4359744	4360385	Nishikawa.
4361246	4362508	Yeah, very clever indeed, Nick.
4362528	4364230	Nishikawa changing up the pace.
4365070	4369899	Placing it precisely past the block of Wallace.
4377855	4381943	Well, how they would like a couple of aces here from Yuki Ishikawa.
4384207	4385830	For now, there's got some work to do there.
4386839	4389704	not the greatest of service receptions, and can they get themselves out of it?
4389724	4394893	They can because he lay out, you know, and lay out with great touch and depth on that swing.
4395054	4396276	Just lay out having a match.
4396296	4397738	That's his 16th point.
4398500	4402888	And finally showing that he can change the pace up a little bit and still be effective.
4406594	4407075	Wallace.
4413080	4415163	Talis has got that off the floor somehow.
4415223	4416145	Goodness only knows how.
4416165	4420031	Oh, that is a perfect push.
4420051	4420772	Luke Corelli.
4423336	4423957	Goodness me.
4425719	4428664	It's your fans' blockers deciding not to let's lay all their hands out.
4428684	4429425	Luke Corelli, excuse me.
4432991	4434974	Everything going the way of Brazil now?
4435454	4435915	That's OK.
4444484	4447650	You can see from the body language, he knows this.
4448692	4450095	There's no way back from this.
4452860	4454904	Six point deficit here in set number three.
4455465	4457970	Brazil really playing some strong volleyball.
4459182	4463246	Until Yoandil Leal, who had that last point, not look great as I incorrectly picked up.
4463286	4465928	You said it earlier, he's just having one of those games.
4465989	4469492	I mean, he's seeing everything big and slow and everything he's attempting.
4469912	4471714	It just happens like that somehow for you as a player.
4472034	4477600	Everything drops into place and it really has been working for Yoandil Leal today and the last 10 points.
4477620	4479542	I mean, it's been a wipeout.
4480923	4487009	Yeah, Brazil, behind the efforts of Leal, really up their level, just firing on all cylinders.
4487049	4488430	Everybody has contributed.
4489793	4494399	with stood the pressure from the inline for Japan and come right back with their own.
4502249	4503370	By Patak.
4503390	4504251	Drilled that, Thales.
4505853	4512181	By Ishikawa, who will actually come through the net, just to make sure that the Brazil libero is okay.
4512562	4512962	He is.
4516306	4517708	What are the dangers of
4519274	4520597	Standing that close.
4521580	4523685	Tal is getting that one right off of the chin.
4526493	4528478	He's going to take a second just to gather himself.
4530162	4531185	But smiles all around.
4531525	4532929	Yeah, he's OK. Part of the game.
4549902	4551424	Too big a hit from Wallace.
4552686	4557494	It's the consistency of the hitting from Wallace and from Luca Raleigh, and of course we talked about Yoendi Layal.
4557514	4561881	I mean, not been too many unforced errors from that gang of three this afternoon.
4564605	4565667	Ayres have been very limited.
4565967	4567810	Layal, Wallace, Luca Raleigh.
4584682	4586344	Takahashi tries to be clever.
4587205	4588067	It's the right idea.
4588387	4594475	Oh, Luccarelli improvising something there and then it's all gone wrong for Ishikawa.
4595016	4597219	Luccarelli trying to run a quick attack there.
4598040	4604108	He's seen Lucas do it for so long you wanted to get in on that action when Flavio wasn't there with the misconnection.
4604982	4607586	You know, it's good to see Japan smiling and seeing the funny side.
4607606	4612413	This actually sets up a huge third match for them in the pool phase against Cuba.
4613034	4615958	I mean, they've got to get something out of that, or they could face elimination.
4617681	4631682	Yeah, a nice little push there from Ran Takahashi.
4642715	4645299	That's crashing it down there wasn't it Flavio?
4646380	4650226	You know maybe falling two sets behind a Cuban is exactly what this Brazil squad needed.
4650246	4659600	You know they came in after and by their stands that indifferent volleyball nation's league they fall two down and everyone starts looking at them and I think they looked at themselves and said no no no we're better than this.
4659980	4663365	But since then they've just been inspired.
4663425	4667351	Character moment for sure and perhaps it's carried over into this match.
4667391	4670055	I mean this is going to be a statement victory for them that
4670491	4672835	Everybody else in the world championships is going to take note of.
4674197	4674658	Darlan.
4675700	4677362	We know what he can do from the service line.
4677503	4678424	It's another beauty.
4678825	4690244	Ran Takahashi picks it up, but when you're setting from there, you're asking for trouble, and sure enough, there is very little chance for Takahashi there as Miara was setting all the way back to our commentary position there.
4691186	4692027	It's impossible.
4692614	4694518	Very compromised situation for Japan.
4695239	4697082	Setting the ball from that far off the court.
4697343	4698886	This is some weapon to bring off the bench.
4699527	4700188	This really is.
4700228	4702312	I'll tell you, Darlan.
4702833	4704316	Darlan's bringing it when he serves.
4707241	4708243	There goes another one in it.
4708263	4709706	This is devastating.
4709726	4711089	Absolutely devastating.
4711970	4712952	Wow, what a serve.
4718872	4720594	Oh, that had everything.
4721134	4726440	Fly, spin, power, direction.
4726460	4731766	Tomio Miro Yamamoto could not deal with it at all, and there wouldn't have been many players in the world who could.
4733487	4735349	Darlan looking for another big one.
4735369	4736410	That's way too big.
4741636	4742817	But hey, that's job done.
4743518	4745120	That's another really good cameo.
4746161	4748423	Yeah, he gets the other boys on the bench.
4749685	4755491	And Brazil, three points from wrapping this thing up.
4755511	4756171	Takahashi.
4757633	4759234	Picked up by Leal.
4759975	4761396	Lukarelli.
4761416	4762117	No, that's nice.
4762437	4764660	From Ran Takahashi, Ishikawa.
4764700	4766842	No, that's picked up by Yoandil Leal.
4767963	4770605	And then they block him, but the block goes out.
4770665	4772747	So Wallace will claim himself another winner.
4774069	4778613	Miara was certainly there, one of a gang of three from Japan, and they could not keep it in play.
4778713	4779574	And Brazil,
4780853	4782515	Moved to within two points.
4792606	4793748	Fernando serving at 23-14.
4794769	4796150	What a professional job.
4796771	4800035	Renan Balzotto's squad have performed this afternoon.
4802878	4806422	It was a match you thought potentially could have been fraught with danger for Brazil.
4807448	4812274	and they've turned it into a comfortable straight sets victory.
4815478	4819863	You can't even say Japan have played particularly badly, but Brazil have really brought it today.
4822446	4824809	And so Yamachi with a little flash of defiance.
4827532	4833760	Well, that's all it is.
4842312	4843654	Gavacci with serve.
4844215	4845177	Thales picks that up.
4846379	4848282	And that's another one for Wallace.
4849264	4857198	And that brings up an awful lot of match points.
4861726	4866514	The longer it's gone on, there is a chasm has opened up between these two teams.
4867726	4873171	The Japan are staring down the barrel of a pretty comprehensive straight sets defeat here.
4875814	4878457	Lukarelli.
4878477	4882421	Sekita manages to set up Miara, and he's found himself a winner there.
4884062	4887986	Oh, Kento Miara.
4888006	4890148	Forcing Lukarelli to make a decision here.
4890208	4890869	Does he leave it?
4890889	4891710	Does he go for it?
4893492	4894813	And he decided to go for it.
4896008	4901207	That delays the moment.
4901227	4907571	Miara will be lining up to serve once we've got the moisture cleaned off the floor.
4928054	4930487	Yara serves Thales, that could be an overpass.
4930507	4940140	Fernando has somehow rescued it one-handed and Lucas puts it away and that point right there sums up Brazil's quality.

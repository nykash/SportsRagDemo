1
00:00:03,946 --> 00:00:08,061
What a start, what a start.

2
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:10,250
I mean you can't do it any better than that.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,867
That's one way to start a match up with a clean ace between Luca Raleigh and Talis there.

4
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:17,934
There's the old story.

5
00:00:17,954 --> 00:00:21,878
If you can split two of them, they either both go for it, or at night of them go for it.

6
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:22,579
They both leave it.

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:23,600
That's what he got there.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,842
And they both had to go for that one.

9
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:26,223
It's another beautiful serve.

10
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:28,405
That'll get picked up by Yamamoto.

11
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,507
He'll do a lot of that.

12
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:32,049
And then Nishida pops up far side.

13
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:33,030
That's contained.

14
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:36,714
Fernando will set up the Piper tag.

15
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:38,797
And that's a bit of a surprise.

16
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,741
Oh, that pushed too long.

17
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:43,682
Two attacks.

18
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:45,664
No kills yet for Brazil.

19
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:54,164
down 0-2 here very early on, but not perhaps the greatest start that the Brazilians were looking for.

20
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:56,147
Yeah, Luca really pushing it.

21
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:58,591
Nishida with another ace.

22
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:00,834
And again, he's got both of them going for it.

23
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:04,840
I mean, his lasers are fine-tuned here.

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,324
He's dropping it between two players every time.

25
00:01:07,364 --> 00:01:08,005
Here's another one.

26
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:11,951
Nishida is just so strong, this time attacking the seam of Leal and Thales.

27
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:16,798
His second ace of the match and just three serves.

28
00:01:19,428 --> 00:01:21,190
Now, Philly Blaine is saying, you carry on like that.

29
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,512
Let's have another 22 like that.

30
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:28,160
Well, is he going to fight with another one?

31
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,022
No, he's not.

32
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:32,085
That's a job done by Eugene Nishida.

33
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:34,929
Devastating burst of serving to open up this match.

34
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:40,556
Side out, we'll see Lucas Suck come back there.

35
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:42,759
He won this competition back in 2010.

36
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:45,503
Still going.

37
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:54,443
It's easier to say what Lucas Sackkamp hasn't had a major medal in.

38
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:56,507
I mean, he's got the full set.

39
00:01:56,527 --> 00:02:00,534
His resume is extremely long and very decorated.

40
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:04,921
And club and international level opens up with a long serve.

41
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:07,305
Japan with the early jump here.

42
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:15,400
Not Suka serving Luccarelli, who just about deals with that.

43
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,282
That's Wallace with no real play on there.

44
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:21,827
A little whiff there, I think, in the middle from Onadira, and they pay for that.

45
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:23,689
Yohendi Leal says that's enough of that.

46
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:29,255
That's an attack matchup that's advantage to Brazil.

47
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:36,803
Leal attacking against Sekita, the smaller setter, but that time Leal goes hard cross court for the winner.

48
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:42,983
So Wallace, another one of these veterans with serve.

49
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:43,744
It's a nice take.

50
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:44,566
Look out.

51
00:02:44,926 --> 00:02:47,511
Eugene Nishida absolutely rips it down there.

52
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:54,062
I mean, that's Thales who gets everything back in the backcourt for Brazil, but that was just too hot even for him to handle.

53
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:57,728
Nishida off to a brilliant start here.

54
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,934
That's his third point of the match.

55
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:10,890
The net serve from Aladira, side out.

56
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:24,647
Leal.

57
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:28,312
Oh, nice.

58
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:29,333
Nice.

59
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,576
Hey, they need a kick start.

60
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:34,880
Maybe Joanne Leal can provide it.

61
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,785
Well, Brazil gets an ace back this time from Leal, challenging that seam.

62
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:41,908
Yamamoto, we should have taken that one.

63
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:47,454
So Leal looking to level it up here for Brazil.

64
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:53,400
And he does with another ace and a completely different serve that's swirled away from Ran Takahashi.

65
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,964
Well, this is outstanding serving from Yande Leal.

66
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,146
And this is one of the hardest balls to pass.

67
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:02,570
Straight at you, actually going away from Ran to his line.

68
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:06,855
Line to line serve from Leal for another ace.

69
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,177
It's been a while since we've had a hat trick of aces.

70
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:12,066
And we're going to have to wait again.

71
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:17,533
It's a much better take from Ran Takahashi who comes up with third touch as well.

72
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:21,357
And it's a perfect one right at the feet of the back row defender.

73
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:26,864
Great pass leads to great in-system offense and Ran Takahashi attacking against Fernando.

74
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:29,126
That's advantage Japan all match long.

75
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,511
Masahiro Sakita, the setter.

76
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:36,615
Oh, he's found a nice.

77
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:43,070
I mean, Sakita's not known for his devastating serving, but sometimes it's about placement.

78
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:50,059
It doesn't have the power that Nishida has, but the placement is equally as effective through the seam and deep into the court.

79
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:54,325
The ace is coming thick and fast in this match.

80
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:57,710
Fernando goes for the quick inside second.

81
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,053
That's Flavio flying high there.

82
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:01,895
Flavio, which is so athletic.

83
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:04,299
Works hard to get around, Fernando.

84
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,463
Running that drift pattern.

85
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:14,924
floats away from the center and opens up that wrist away angle for the point.

86
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:18,228
Zekita with the forward inside set, that doesn't work.

87
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:29,383
So we'll have another go here with Yamauchi and they contain that Brazil and now they look to transition with Luccarelli ripping it off the block and Brazil starting to go through the gears here now after that slow start.

88
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,667
Now the Brazilian squad has to get momentum behind them, right?

89
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:40,276
Nishita started this match out with some quality serving, but Luca Raleigh getting a chance to get activated in the front row.

90
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:42,879
Scores on that first attack.

91
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,541
Flavio stays on serve.

92
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:45,062
No, he doesn't.

93
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:45,562
Side out.

94
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:47,485
Sends that on a little bit too deep.

95
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:50,829
Both teams have been very, very aggressive with their serves, which you like to see.

96
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:55,335
But it means you will get some deep long serves.

97
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,457
You'll get some net serves.

98
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:59,060
Here is Iran, Takahashi.

99
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,602
21 in a few days time.

100
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,921
full of youthful energy.

101
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:06,647
Again, it's a really nice pick up on Luca Rally.

102
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:10,174
Full of energy at 30 years old as well.

103
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:13,841
Part of the Olympic gold medal winning score for Brazil.

104
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:14,923
That'll be a fun matchup.

105
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:20,174
Luca Rally hitting against Nishita and vice versa, obviously.

106
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:22,438
Luca Rally winning that first challenge.

107
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:32,845
Fernando plays his club volleyball in Italy for Monza with serve.

108
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:40,655
That's picked up off the floor and that'll go out to Nishida who tries a little bit of finesse and the block was there to contain it and goes for a big power swing instead this time.

109
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:42,278
And again, Talis can't deal with it.

110
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:45,402
That's two that Nishida has zipped past the Brazil libero.

111
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:47,124
Now Luca's got stuck at the net.

112
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:48,066
It's the only blocker.

113
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:53,092
Nishida sees the alley and flushes that ball off the libero.

114
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,859
Here a Yamauchi.

115
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,166
It's picked up by Thales.

116
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:10,252
And the lovely angle taken there on the crosscourt from Luca Relli.

117
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:16,859
Now, Luca Relli had ankle all day to attack as that Suka drifted past the antenna on this move.

118
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,923
Luca Relli knows exactly what to do with that set.

119
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:32,757
Oh, my goodness, what a pick up that was.

120
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:55,082
So that's going to be collected by Luccarelli backcourt and hello Well, you won't see that too often Lucas are come straight into the net This opportunity there is Lucas got a great deflection On his block however the connection between him and Fernando Not firing there

121
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,341
Nishida, and it's another sizzler it really is.

122
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:01,688
That's sent backwards.

123
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:06,372
Luccarelli setting from about five metres behind the back line.

124
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:08,777
but they do keep it in play.

125
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:11,542
Now Sekita has options and he'll send it to Otsuka.

126
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:13,264
That doesn't come up with a winner either.

127
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,086
This could be trouble.

128
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:20,196
Yohan Delayal almost taking the head of Rantakashi off there, but he's kept it in play.

129
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:22,079
And then they come up with the winner as well.

130
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,442
That's typical Japan defense.

131
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,985
Just send everything back.

132
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:32,916
Yeah, great defense in the backcourt from Japan after a strong serve again from the inline.

133
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:36,327
Both teams working really hard.

134
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:37,768
Here's another dig.

135
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:39,330
Just back over the net.

136
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,591
Keep the rally going.

137
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:43,154
Lukareli has to step in and set.

138
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:45,777
And it's a block that catches Wallace on the way out.

139
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:52,223
That's a big bonus for Japan.

140
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,391
Nishida.

141
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:01,053
No.

142
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,754
Brazil, very happy to see that one go long.

143
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:03,375
Yeah, they are.

144
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:08,335
Deep Saira leave, saying that she'd have missed that serve.

145
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:15,642
Lucas at 10-11.

146
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:31,557
Sekid has to scramble around and Otsuka has done really well because the three-man block had all data get set there and bad things could have happened but Tatsunori Otsuka rubbed it off the block an hour.

147
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:54,338
Japan escaping this one a great serve from Lucas to the corner and then a really well-formed three-man block, but Japan gets the side out Another really good serve Talies has to hoist that one up there and Luke Carelli Can't get a winner, but Yamamoto setting from behind his baseline and somehow that's been shoveled over goodness only knows how

148
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:57,519
Yoendilay, I can't find a winner, Sekita.

149
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,484
As they go back in the system and did that catch the line?

150
00:10:00,504 --> 00:10:01,546
No, it did not.

151
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:03,068
Otsuka goes too long.

152
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:06,173
That's a missed opportunity, Japan.

153
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:07,075
Yeah, it certainly is.

154
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,022
Otsuka just misses the contact.

155
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:19,336
Trying for the corner, but it was just long.

156
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:19,937
Wallace.

157
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:47,993
He's put a little bit too much under that one as well.

158
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:50,256
That really caught a thermal on the way over the net, didn't it?

159
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:51,738
A bit of a tail in on that one.

160
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:53,721
Pushed it way out of bounds.

161
00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:08,508
Uandy Leal, the Cuban born outside hitter, zings that one too deep and we're getting a rash of service errors now.

162
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:13,697
Part of the reason for that is both these sides know you can't play safe at this level.

163
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:15,259
You've got to do something.

164
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,484
The borrow was set early on with two aces.

165
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:20,808
And a response from Brazil.

166
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:22,611
Now the service pressure continues.

167
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:28,690
Sakita's serve is picked up by Leal, Fernando has to scramble around and that allowed the block to get set.

168
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,198
And you know what, that might have been Ran Takahashi getting the final touch on that one.

169
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,988
That's a real bonus for Japan if Ran is getting block points.

170
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,076
That is him as well.

171
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:43,299
This ball has got to get covered by either Flavio or Lael.

172
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:45,341
They're both standing there, watching it hit the floor.

173
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:48,544
Hey, hey, let's get together here.

174
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:51,047
Hey, let's get together here.

175
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:54,691
The first thing is to hit two of them.

176
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:57,313
To the miss, don't let go of the line.

177
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,675
She can't let you go out, okay?

178
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:00,737
To the left, on top of the line.

179
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:01,898
He's marking the hand for him.

180
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:03,279
It's a good marking.

181
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,040
Keep it there.

182
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:04,721
Okay?

183
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:05,421
Get out of there.

184
00:12:05,582 --> 00:12:07,143
I'm going to close the Miolo of the block.

185
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,085
Leave the risk for them.

186
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:20,839
Well, here's what's happened in the last 10 points.

187
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:23,362
Japan have opened up a nice healthy lead again.

188
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,630
There's such an air of confidence about this Japan squad.

189
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:36,557
We saw it in the volleyball nations league early this year and they went to the quarter-final stage, which was their best result.

190
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:40,637
You know, they hosted their own Olympics, got to the quarterfinals there.

191
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,782
They're suddenly banging on the door of being a top, top contender now.

192
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,070
Ooh, did Flavio get anything on that?

193
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,033
No, he did not get a touch on the way through.

194
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:57,283
Well, so far the middle attackers for Brazil not finding the court.

195
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:02,190
Flavio trying for the hard angle, but missing wide.

196
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:17,074
Sekita's serve is not particularly well handled, but the down the line from Wallace is an absolutely drill that Yamamoto, who just has to send it spinning off at a crazy angle.

197
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:21,600
The set from Fernando and Wallace able to turn that one hard down the line.

198
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:27,648
So that'll set up Flavio, Brazil with points to make up here.

199
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,333
Sekita will pick that up nicely.

200
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:41,446
Nishida is also picked up by Wallace in the backcourt there and now Wallace can try and scuff that one over and how many touches are they going to have?

201
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:50,318
Bit unlucky for Japan that time it was a good block move they got some hands on that attack as well just not able to play it cleanly out of the net

202
00:13:57,082 --> 00:13:59,385
Flavio serving Otsuka.

203
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:02,090
Nice from Miyamachi.

204
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,355
Good execution.

205
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,636
Well, that all started with the pass.

206
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:11,364
Japan hasn't been able to run their middles very much, but they got a perfect pass and system that time.

207
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,687
They score the point through the middle.

208
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:15,951
Brian Takahashi.

209
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:20,878
Well, graduated from college, went straight into the Italian League, playing for Padua.

210
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:23,773
Boom.

211
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:25,736
Joanne Leal sends that back with interest.

212
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:26,737
He's in Italy as well.

213
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:30,662
We'll be with Pierre Chinz the next season.

214
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:32,725
Just a perfectly timed, big attack.

215
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:34,727
You see both blockers jumping on Lucas.

216
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,413
Leal can take care of that one all day long.

217
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:40,755
So Brazil staying close here.

218
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,717
Fernando can get him a bit closer.

219
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:48,064
He's getting a nice pass, but an even better block from Lucas.

220
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,114
Lucas was just one of the best middle blockers in the world.

221
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:53,098
So experienced.

222
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:54,323
What a reaction.

223
00:14:54,805 --> 00:14:58,560
Just gets his hands up and over the net and the monster block.

224
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,752
So Fernando looking to level this one up.

225
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,297
Good response, this from Brazil.

226
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:10,263
That's got to be good and is.

227
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:12,530
I tell you what, Suga's found the corner there beautifully.

228
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,934
Just clipping that baseline.

229
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,281
Yeah, Suga's had a good start to this match.

230
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:19,350
It's his third point here in this opening set.

231
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:24,488
Yeah, he's the guy that's in the starting line-up with Ishikawa on the bench, the captain.

232
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:38,385
We saw Ishikawa come off the bench against Kata, and I know you were talking to Coach Philippe Blaine earlier in the week, and he alluded to just the management of some niggling injuries for Ishikawa, so they're not gonna work him too hard this early in the tournament.

233
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:41,288
It is all about managing your players through a tournament like this.

234
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:49,438
So whether we see Ishikawa or not remains to be seen.

235
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:52,305
What he's not ready to be, obviously, is a workhorse at the moment.

236
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:56,150
And that means others can step up like Otsuka.

237
00:15:58,253 --> 00:15:59,515
Yamachi with serve.

238
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:00,516
That's gone.

239
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,105
Now, Fernando and Lucas communicating to each other after that play.

240
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:14,355
Lucas asking for a little bit of a higher set, perhaps, but this time he's able to score the point.

241
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:17,940
Listen, if Lucas is asking for something, Lucas is going to get it.

242
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,773
drilled by Lukarelli, kept alive.

243
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:27,577
Nishida with a clever push, Talies with the pancake to keep it alive as well.

244
00:16:27,597 --> 00:16:32,021
And then the cross call from you, and now is perfect.

245
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:35,565
The Brazil offensive, Jung and Orton is starting to go through the gears here.

246
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:41,150
But what a save to keep that ball alive by the back row player for Brazil.

247
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:46,375
Tied at 18-all and Japan decides to use a timeout.

248
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:50,560
It's OK.

249
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:54,565
It will be a fight at TGM.

250
00:16:54,585 --> 00:17:00,212
We don't forget nothing about the coverage, about everything ready for this.

251
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:01,274
OK?

252
00:17:02,696 --> 00:17:06,360
All right, good.

253
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,582
Don't close, huh?

254
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:08,663
At TGM, we don't close fight.

255
00:17:08,683 --> 00:17:10,405
And you keep fighting.

256
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:11,847
High and low.

257
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:12,508
OK?

258
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:13,609
All right, go.

259
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:16,733
TGM!

260
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:21,930
Philippe Blaine keeping it simple.

261
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:24,674
It's another good response from Brazil.

262
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:27,799
That's twice Japan have had a lead in this match, right at the beginning of course.

263
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:31,985
And they had a healthy looking one at the midpoint of this set.

264
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:34,809
Only to see Brazil comes charging back at them.

265
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:40,678
Let's see what Luca Relli can do here.

266
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,171
picked up off the floor.

267
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,113
Nishida is blocked out of it.

268
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:56,396
That's a wonderful one-handed dig from Ran Takahashi.

269
00:17:56,436 --> 00:17:59,159
And it's just got to be pushed over there from Otsuka, who covered a lot of ground.

270
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,522
But him coming for another dig from Takahashi.

271
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:05,224
And then he's just blocked out of it, though, is Otsuka.

272
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:08,087
Great defense from Brazil.

273
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:08,927
They're all round.

274
00:18:09,027 --> 00:18:10,909
Great defense from Japan.

275
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:12,931
Great blocking from Brazil.

276
00:18:14,112 --> 00:18:15,193
Could have gotten the first one.

277
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:18,816
But Wallace comes through with a huge block this time on Otsuka.

278
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:22,310
scoring the point and finishing off that rally.

279
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:32,026
Natsuka will sit down as Ishikawa will come in.

280
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:33,589
That's probably not a surprise.

281
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,577
We knew we were going to see him at some point in this match, Nick.

282
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:45,240
and they go straight after the new player, as you would, of course.

283
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:49,666
You'll have a chance at swinging at this, and he just runs into the block, but there's too much on it.

284
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:54,552
The block can't control it, so Ishikawa announces his arrival onto court in style.

285
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:07,669
First swing of the match, off the bench comes in and blasting it off of Lucas' hands, and out of balance.

286
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:11,117
He's looking for it every time, using the sheet.

287
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:13,380
He's not looking at containing serves.

288
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,863
He's looking to put the pressure on every time.

289
00:19:16,003 --> 00:19:20,729
He has the green light, as we say, to get after it as hard as he can every single time.

290
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:27,979
Lucas, 2019, with a little net skimmer from him.

291
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:29,721
Sekita sends it to Ishikawa.

292
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:34,247
That one's going to fall perfectly, perfectly for Yohande Layal.

293
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:38,762
Sometimes you need a bit of luck, and I'll tell you, you're in Leal at that on a plate.

294
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:50,039
Well, Wallace isn't going to get credit for the block, but the deflection is just as good as it goes right to Leal, and he cleans it up.

295
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:55,727
Lucas, Brazil going through the gears and put themselves in a good position here.

296
00:19:55,747 --> 00:20:00,193
That was Ishikawa running into the containing block, but that's better.

297
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:01,795
Fernando would love to have that one back.

298
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:04,960
It got past the block, and I don't think Fernando was expecting that.

299
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:08,112
Oh, Fernando kind of charges in.

300
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,403
Catches him up high.

301
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:17,074
But a missed defensive opportunity that time.

302
00:20:17,094 --> 00:20:21,164
Japan still looking for the point on serve to get him back level.

303
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,269
Ishikawa.

304
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:25,940
serves Leal, who handles that one perfectly.

305
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,742
We looked at what an angle.

306
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:29,144
What an angle he took there.

307
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:32,469
I mean, Takahashi was there to cover it, but just couldn't get a play on that at all.

308
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:33,130
It was too good.

309
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:37,276
This angle, challenging the middle, blasting it past the left hand.

310
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,362
An extreme angle from Leal on the left side here.

311
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:43,625
Yeah, Ranzakashi's got that cover.

312
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:44,306
He read it all the way.

313
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,848
You just couldn't do anything with it.

314
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,437
Wallace, another powerful serve.

315
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,459
That'll go inside.

316
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,063
Wallace picks that up on the dig.

317
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,185
Fernanda goes back side.

318
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:56,051
Long crosscourt sat there to Luca Relli.

319
00:20:57,513 --> 00:21:00,039
And Fernanda, oh, just a bit out of sync there.

320
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:00,960
Will it get away with it?

321
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:01,862
Yeah, Flavio.

322
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:03,125
No, it's still going.

323
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:08,275
Well, that's Japan's scrambling defense at its best.

324
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:14,112
But in the end, it's a really clean cross-court kill from Yohande Leal that ends that rally.

325
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:16,035
Yeah, a great swing on the right side.

326
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:21,662
Some chaos throughout that play, but Leal getting stuck on the right side because they switched their blockers.

327
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:24,206
Fernando went to the left, Leal to the right.

328
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:26,509
That's why he's attacking on the right side on the counter attack.

329
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:33,418
This might just be a catch of breath time out.

330
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:37,978
So, both sides, they make pressure outside the block.

331
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:38,799
That's my king.

332
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:42,184
So, you should be ready for taking this, huh?

333
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:51,800
Hey, we tried to come to a quick, a quick, a quick pipe and open side.

334
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:58,410
Ah, because big, it was working so much.

335
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:10,075
Now Brazil's offense is starting to heat up in the later stages of the set number one now.

336
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:14,823
And the blocking of Japan has got to get a little tighter.

337
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:17,146
Not a lot of three-man blocking.

338
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:20,351
And that wing blocker comes off to play defense.

339
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:24,077
But if they're not going to block, they've got to play some solid defense behind the two-man blocker.

340
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:37,405
Well, can Japan come back from this?

341
00:22:39,428 --> 00:22:43,113
First to 25, remember, with a two-point margin.

342
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:47,519
So Wallace looking to take it to set point.

343
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:49,642
That's a nice pick-up.

344
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:53,647
And there we go, game banner block.

345
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:57,793
I'll tell you, Flavio with Leal alongside him just wiping out Nishida.

346
00:22:57,993 --> 00:23:00,276
Now we're going to see a challenge here come in from Japan.

347
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:07,483
That block had so much pace behind it off of Flavio, but it catches the sideline for sure.

348
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:10,487
It looks like on that replay.

349
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:12,749
But when it's set point, you might as well chuck a challenge down.

350
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:19,957
I agree with you.

351
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:21,299
That looked like it caught plenty.

352
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:24,422
Yeah.

353
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:28,594
That's one of those, what the heck challenge is, isn't it?

354
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:30,677
Well, I mean Japan has to challenge that one.

355
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:33,441
It's a good challenge at this stage of the set.

356
00:23:38,288 --> 00:23:38,869
Set point then.

357
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:43,195
Wallace looking to serve it out, that slow start from Brazil.

358
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:48,042
A distant memory here, side out, but Japan will need three points on their own serve.

359
00:23:48,563 --> 00:23:51,287
They'll switch it up and bring in Kento Miyada.

360
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,324
There's a precious situation for Miara.

361
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:03,506
Off the bench.

362
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:05,168
Come on, save three set points.

363
00:24:10,676 --> 00:24:12,839
It's a decent effort with the first one.

364
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:16,865
Somehow, Lucarelli's got under it along with Thales, and he's well off net there, Yoandilay.

365
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:19,368
And still finds a clean winner.

366
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:22,874
I mean, Brazil just powering their way through that set the longer it went on.

367
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:28,041
And from a slow start, Brazil started to crank it up, and once they did,

368
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:32,185
Covered that second lead that Japan had they, but they won that set pulling away.

369
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:35,970
Yeah, they found themselves down by three points twice in this opener.

370
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:55,851
But once they regained the lead, it didn't give it up and lay out with a huge swing here to finish off set number one high off the hands.

371
00:24:57,586 --> 00:24:58,827
That's as sweet as you like.

372
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:01,130
And Renan Dalzotto says, that's how we do it.

373
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,091
That's how we roll.

374
00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:08,198
So a slow star, but a very strong finish.

375
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:10,261
Brazil securing the first set.

376
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:11,803
25 to 21.

377
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:17,810
And this is how they did it by the numbers.

378
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,594
Three to two blocks, five aces with three going to Japan.

379
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:26,800
The attack points very heavily favoring Brazil.

380
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:34,046
Great block in defense and great serving in that opener.

381
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:38,573
Setting the table for what was expected to be a very exciting match, Nick.

382
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:42,720
And can't really complain about that first set from both sides.

383
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:55,521
Good quality volleyball all the way around.

384
00:26:00,074 --> 00:26:01,576
So placement for Brazil.

385
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,541
Looking like this.

386
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:17,543
A little more heavy to that left side of the court going after that front row outside hitter that's got to pass.

387
00:26:31,765 --> 00:26:39,577
And for Japan, looking like this.

388
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:58,465
Once the big hitter's got into that stride, Wallace and Leal, in particular, Lukarelli.

389
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:05,483
Throw in a couple of blocks, and the Brazil juggernaut.

390
00:27:05,503 --> 00:27:14,113
After a couple, a little bit of a shaky start for Brazil, they found themselves, Leal scoring nine points in that opening set.

391
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:19,899
Nishita with two aces right at the start of the set, didn't contribute, wasn't able to contribute very much after that.

392
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:25,525
Now only two attack points for Nishita through set one, two service ace points.

393
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,650
Defensively they did a number on him,

394
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,967
Whenever Nishida did try to attack, there's always a two-man block.

395
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,130
He didn't get any one-on-ones.

396
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:45,351
That was an exciting opener.

397
00:27:45,712 --> 00:27:49,140
Let's hope set number two is equally as exciting here.

398
00:28:04,628 --> 00:28:09,113
It'll be Fernando to get this second set underway.

399
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:16,260
Yamamoto picks that up, then Mishita can't get the better of Thales.

400
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,842
Backside it goes.

401
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:23,028
Neat, neat as you like for Wallace DeSousa, dropping into the feet of the back row defender there.

402
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:27,793
Wallace is just so deceptive on his attacking from the right side.

403
00:28:27,893 --> 00:28:32,678
Faces angle, but has that whip of an arm that can turn it right back down the line.

404
00:28:37,163 --> 00:28:39,567
Fernando does bring a bit of spite to his serves.

405
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:45,556
She takes everything off that one, so Keita can go back side and the Sheeter again is blocked out of it.

406
00:28:46,077 --> 00:28:51,185
So it's scramble time for Japan and they almost scrambled something rather good out of that from Ishikawa.

407
00:28:52,988 --> 00:28:53,488
Oh dear.

408
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,652
That's a big miss.

409
00:28:56,072 --> 00:28:57,435
That's a really big miss.

410
00:28:57,455 --> 00:28:59,678
Taishi Onodira won't want to see a replay of this.

411
00:29:00,957 --> 00:29:04,326
Now, Brazil not happy with that no call on that third ball over.

412
00:29:04,387 --> 00:29:06,412
That was clearly a double contact.

413
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:07,094
Great effort.

414
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:15,979
This is the contact that they're not happy with, but an attack through the middle from Japan results in that hitting air.

415
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:25,598
Fernando drills it.

416
00:29:25,618 --> 00:29:26,599
It's another strong serve.

417
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:28,080
He's mixing up his serves really well.

418
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,224
Ishikawa picked it up, but his third touch wasn't particularly devastating.

419
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:35,648
And the block, I tell you, Taishi Onodera gets some redemption there for the earlier miss.

420
00:29:35,988 --> 00:29:37,470
The stuffed block, straight back.

421
00:29:39,492 --> 00:29:41,514
Lugarelli couldn't get it past the block this time.

422
00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:47,299
A nice move by Japan, and the left hand there, shutting it down for the monster block.

423
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:48,200
Well over the net.

424
00:29:49,161 --> 00:29:52,024
Perfectly executed block move there from the middle.

425
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:53,766
Nishida.

426
00:29:56,932 --> 00:29:58,375
Oh, that's not a great take at all.

427
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:00,098
Somehow that's been rescued.

428
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,690
Tough to get a winner from there, but they are still trying to put something aggressive on it, and then Nishida does finish the job.

429
00:30:07,191 --> 00:30:08,974
It all went wrong on service reception there.

430
00:30:09,014 --> 00:30:14,164
Anytime it goes careering off in the direction of your coach and the bench, it's not good.

431
00:30:20,894 --> 00:30:22,837
So Ishida restoring parity.

432
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:25,460
2-2, set two.

433
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:32,250
Oh, I tell you, that's another huge swing.

434
00:30:33,451 --> 00:30:35,094
Somehow, they all got enough underneath it.

435
00:30:35,815 --> 00:30:36,796
Wallace just has to shut.

436
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:37,837
Oh, that's a bonus.

437
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:38,859
What a bonus that is.

438
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:42,824
I tell you, Sakita and Ishikawa are not happy about something here.

439
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:50,715
Now the horn went off right after the serve was hit.

440
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,568
Bit of a mystery buzzer going off.

441
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:10,327
Yeah, it doesn't help anybody, does it?

442
00:31:10,347 --> 00:31:12,950
I mean, it's the old cliche, this hands-off you play to the whistle.

443
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,893
Well, that was the equivalent of the whistle.

444
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:22,231
Now coach Felipe Lane has a legitimate argument.

445
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:25,905
He wants a replay, but he's not going to get it.

446
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:27,591
Nope.

447
00:31:27,812 --> 00:31:28,615
The point stands.

448
00:31:29,177 --> 00:31:30,422
It is 3-2 Brazil.

449
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:38,073
Luccarelli with a hot one around Takahashi, picks it up nicely, Nishida rips through.

450
00:31:38,994 --> 00:31:41,739
Somehow that has gone into the net and Leal's recovered.

451
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,885
Oh my goodness, Luccarelli with the swing of the match so far.

452
00:31:46,226 --> 00:31:48,649
That looked like a dead ball completely.

453
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:53,036
Somehow they've reacted and what a way to finish the rally from Luccarelli.

454
00:31:56,241 --> 00:31:57,563
That's off the charts, good.

455
00:31:58,565 --> 00:31:59,346
What a play.

456
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,236
Lukareli again.

457
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:10,299
Slappy angle served there.

458
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,343
Yamamoto has done well to pick up, and the blocks worked out.

459
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:17,308
Once again, Lukas celebrates sending that one back.

460
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,611
Lukas and Wall is pairing up nicely that time.

461
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:27,562
And Japan just can't find the rhythm with their left side attacker.

462
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:35,813
Forced them to call a timeout here early and set to.

463
00:32:36,974 --> 00:32:37,736
Something was good.

464
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:42,850
Remember, when the opponent is playing good, go slowly.

465
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,655
Keep the ball a little bit higher.

466
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:51,895
Keep it stronger, high, long, and you can cover, and you can keep the ball working.

467
00:32:52,077 --> 00:33:00,967
He knows these players very well.

468
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:06,032
He was the assistant to Yuiichi Nakagaiichi for four years.

469
00:33:06,092 --> 00:33:10,017
He's been there for a number of years.

470
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:18,726
When Nakagaiichi decided to call it a career and retire,

471
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:27,494
And Philippe Blaine was the obvious upgrade in terms of just moving him up from the staff to the head job for the Japan Federation.

472
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:37,787
Sekita has to travel there, and Ishikawa doesn't really get a great touch on him, but it was enough sneaky stuff there to get the better of the block.

473
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:42,874
Yeah, Brazil working hard to get three blockers up after that great serve from Lukarelli, but...

474
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:46,370
Japan a bit lucky on that one to go off the block and down.

475
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,233
Yeah, hopefully Blaine's face told the story.

476
00:33:49,493 --> 00:33:51,095
Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.

477
00:33:53,217 --> 00:33:53,878
Ishikawa.

478
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,681
Whoa, close, close.

479
00:33:58,543 --> 00:34:00,925
Look long.

480
00:34:00,945 --> 00:34:01,766
But not very long.

481
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:04,269
Not very long and nearly a touch of a layout.

482
00:34:10,355 --> 00:34:12,237
Lucas at 6-3 Brazil.

483
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:17,288
Ishikawa with a lovely pass.

484
00:34:19,051 --> 00:34:27,863
Really well kept up there by Lucas off the block and away, but they'll scramble this back somehow, hoisted up there by Sekita, free ball Brazil.

485
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:28,984
Where are they going to go with it?

486
00:34:29,425 --> 00:34:30,086
A far side.

487
00:34:30,326 --> 00:34:31,047
Thank you very much.

488
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:33,070
See you later, says Wallace de Souza.

489
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:37,296
Yeah, Wallace going with that fast set inside.

490
00:34:37,596 --> 00:34:40,941
Look at that contact point, well over the block and down.

491
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:45,295
Bruno says golf clap.

492
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:47,319
He approves.

493
00:34:48,301 --> 00:34:50,224
If he approves, it must have been good.

494
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,514
Lucas drilling it at Ram Takahashi.

495
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,636
His pass is terrific.

496
00:34:57,257 --> 00:34:59,642
And he gets the benefit of third touch as well.

497
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:02,828
Lovely pass there from Ram Takahashi.

498
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:26,453
Ran just gets the one-on-one against Wallace Japan still got some damage to repair here on Adera Up next

499
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,246
Another big power for Swing through there from Yo-Ni-Le-Ao.

500
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:35,288
Sekita's had to cover an awful lot of ground there.

501
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,752
And that's a really nice take.

502
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:39,855
Ran Takahashi off the block and away.

503
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,559
But Sekita's getting all the credit for that.

504
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,942
The ground he covered there to make that set.

505
00:35:45,163 --> 00:35:46,264
And the bump set too.

506
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,829
That Ron can attack high off the hands and score.

507
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:58,161
They needed that point in Japan.

508
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,482
back within touching distance here.

509
00:36:01,923 --> 00:36:03,766
Onadera will stay on serve.

510
00:36:04,627 --> 00:36:08,534
Fernando sends it near side and Yondele Al just rips that crosscourt.

511
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:11,859
Just nothing that Ishikawa could do about that.

512
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:18,089
Leal against Seketa and Leal will win that challenge every single time.

513
00:36:19,932 --> 00:36:21,955
So much speed behind that attack.

514
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:32,026
Wallace finds nothing but Nylon.

515
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,363
So that'll be Sekita back to the service line.

516
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,233
Did find an ace earlier, but that one's not going to be an ace.

517
00:36:53,914 --> 00:36:54,855
That's going to be Iced.

518
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:56,177
Wallace.

519
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:03,768
Wallace comes right back with a huge swing out of the back row.

520
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:06,510
So much line for him to attack.

521
00:37:07,871 --> 00:37:09,553
Takes advantage of it.

522
00:37:09,573 --> 00:37:11,295
Well, that's an illustration of what we talked about, Matt.

523
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:14,237
At this level, if you serve, it doesn't put any pressure on the opponent.

524
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:15,298
That's what's going to happen.

525
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:17,120
There's a serve that put pressure on the opponent.

526
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,302
The overpass ruthlessly punished by Luccarelli.

527
00:37:25,268 --> 00:37:26,909
And Brazil just panning their lead here.

528
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,012
And Yamamoto sending it back.

529
00:37:30,768 --> 00:37:32,051
Look really so.

530
00:37:32,071 --> 00:37:32,532
We don't want it.

531
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:37,284
Get rid of that.

532
00:37:37,304 --> 00:37:42,718
So Lael will serve into the net.

533
00:38:01,396 --> 00:38:02,998
Tales picks that one up.

534
00:38:03,018 --> 00:38:04,139
Fernando covers some ground.

535
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,581
Lucarelli with the clever push.

536
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:07,103
Yamamoto does manage to get there.

537
00:38:07,143 --> 00:38:09,866
Rishi Kaur at the three meter line is wiped out.

538
00:38:10,307 --> 00:38:15,152
Absolutely blown away there by Flavio, who had a long time to get himself set there.

539
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,914
You take it from that deep off the net.

540
00:38:17,435 --> 00:38:18,677
You're asking for trouble.

541
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:22,902
Yeah, Flavio doing a great job to get his hands over and in front of the hitter.

542
00:38:24,223 --> 00:38:28,348
Strong left hand there from a very veteran blocker in Flavio.

543
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:36,416
who will now go to the service line and flirted with the foot fault there.

544
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:43,747
But the overpass as Japan's receiving is just not at the highest level at the moment in this second set.

545
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:45,129
That's two or three overpass.

546
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:46,911
I think we've seen now from them in this set.

547
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:51,518
And that is usually what is going to happen if you overpass.

548
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,832
So Flavio will stay on.

549
00:38:55,214 --> 00:38:56,797
Yamamoto picks that one up.

550
00:38:57,979 --> 00:38:59,641
Lovely defensive work from Flavio.

551
00:39:01,124 --> 00:39:03,527
And then a big swing, but nothing doing for Wallace.

552
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:04,489
It's come back somehow.

553
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:08,335
So Luca Relli goes for a little bit of touch and finishes the job.

554
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:11,800
So Keita was stranded mid-court, trying to get there and couldn't.

555
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,705
Look at all these hitters coming from Brazil.

556
00:39:15,506 --> 00:39:16,568
Three hitters lay out.

557
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:17,910
Lucas, Luca Relli.

558
00:39:18,785 --> 00:39:19,747
Manly the outside hitter.

559
00:39:20,368 --> 00:39:22,551
Places it gently to the floor for the point.

560
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,653
Just floated down a little bit long, Flavio.

561
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:45,147
But overall, Matt, you know, we're only a second and a half in, but, you know, we were talking about that little bit of that invincibility thing, maybe not there for Brazil.

562
00:39:45,498 --> 00:39:49,302
They breezed their way through a very good Japan team through a set and a half here.

563
00:39:49,502 --> 00:39:50,864
They're looking very strong right now.

564
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:51,665
Really strong.

565
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:56,410
Yamauchi serves Leal.

566
00:39:56,991 --> 00:39:58,512
He doesn't handle it particularly well.

567
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:01,716
But they get something out of it thanks to Wallace.

568
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:10,486
You think if you've got Luca Relli setting off court, you've got a chance if you're the defending team.

569
00:40:10,806 --> 00:40:13,009
But Wallace didn't give them that chance.

570
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:14,290
So Fernando.

571
00:40:15,502 --> 00:40:16,784
We'll now serve at 14-8.

572
00:40:16,964 --> 00:40:19,488
Sends a short one in.

573
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:20,790
Nadira picks that up.

574
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:23,314
And that's more like it from Eugene Nishida.

575
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:31,547
The big left-handed swing near side this time off Lucarelli and Lucas.

576
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:36,595
Now Nishida, that's his first attack point of this set.

577
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:40,581
Japan needs him to score for their side.

578
00:40:41,675 --> 00:40:46,100
Well, after that explosive start when he went off like a bottle of champagne, they just had the court taken out of it.

579
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,925
I mean, you know, they've given him nothing, Brazil, until that moment there.

580
00:40:51,086 --> 00:40:59,014
Yeah.

581
00:40:59,034 --> 00:40:59,935
It's run on a big one.

582
00:41:00,857 --> 00:41:11,108
Too big.

583
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,211
Ran Takahashi picks that up.

584
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:22,258
Sekita has to travel.

585
00:41:22,822 --> 00:41:24,473
Ishikawa runs into the block.

586
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:28,369
The block's there again as Ishikawa is off net this time.

587
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,092
And Lukarelli comes up to set.

588
00:41:31,112 --> 00:41:32,774
Wallace tries to go cross-court.

589
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:35,317
Sekita will now send a cross-court for Ishikawa.

590
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:36,878
There's the block, but out it goes.

591
00:41:36,898 --> 00:41:38,780
They got three in the block.

592
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,164
But Ishikawa, the captain, still managed to conjure up a winner.

593
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:46,109
Yeah, great set, that time from Sekita all the way out.

594
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:53,717
And three blockers, Leal, the last one to get there results in that attack going off his hands and then out of bounds.

595
00:41:53,697 --> 00:41:56,060
And Ishida and Sekita check out here.

596
00:41:58,384 --> 00:41:59,966
Japan look to try and mix things up.

597
00:42:00,907 --> 00:42:03,551
Sending out Masaki Oya, the back-up center.

598
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:07,256
And Kento Miyara, the young opposite.

599
00:42:10,421 --> 00:42:11,122
Ishikawa.

600
00:42:12,183 --> 00:42:13,065
That's a clever serve.

601
00:42:14,446 --> 00:42:17,511
But once Lukarelli got underneath, or Leal got underneath it, should I say.

602
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:21,156
It was one, two, three, finished by Lukas.

603
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:28,615
Just an absolutely beautiful angle that time from Lucas on that 31 set.

604
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:03,075
on Adira.

605
00:43:03,095 --> 00:43:04,557
Really soft serve that one.

606
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:06,159
Wallace is blocked out.

607
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:09,784
Yamauchi got over there.

608
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:10,485
No, no, no.

609
00:43:11,346 --> 00:43:12,308
You're not having that one.

610
00:43:13,129 --> 00:43:14,631
Now Japan can celebrate that one.

611
00:43:14,671 --> 00:43:17,355
One of their few blocks they've gotten in this match so far.

612
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:21,400
Right hand of Ron getting that block point.

613
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,391
Onodera.

614
00:43:27,672 --> 00:43:28,633
Sneaky little serve.

615
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:29,915
Fernando brings it near side.

616
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:31,016
Leal down the line.

617
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:32,137
Doesn't get a winner.

618
00:43:32,258 --> 00:43:33,719
Oya was there to pick that up.

619
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:35,501
There's a cross call picked up by Thales.

620
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:38,965
Fernando sends it inside another brilliant dig by Oya.

621
00:43:39,886 --> 00:43:40,827
And that's going to come over.

622
00:43:40,867 --> 00:43:43,971
And Fernando will set up Leal again.

623
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:45,353
And he still can't get a winner.

624
00:43:45,433 --> 00:43:46,794
Oya with another one.

625
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:47,936
I tell you something.

626
00:43:48,016 --> 00:43:51,560
Masaki Oya with three digs on that point.

627
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,323
And that's outstanding defensive work.

628
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:57,294
There it is.

629
00:43:57,354 --> 00:44:02,440
Great pick up, but Ishikawa then hammering this ball on two.

630
00:44:03,821 --> 00:44:04,943
Lavio made a good read.

631
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:08,507
What an effort from Japan.

632
00:44:09,228 --> 00:44:17,998
Yeah, Ishikawa gets the credit for the kill point, obviously, but Oya dig off to dig off to dig, and now Brazil is saying, oh, we want to stop this little charge.

633
00:44:21,337 --> 00:44:46,819
Renan's out, Dalzotto.

634
00:44:48,161 --> 00:44:51,023
Sensing the momentum swing there.

635
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:56,122
The old story isn't that, when you come off the bench you always want to make a mark.

636
00:44:56,182 --> 00:45:00,826
Let people know you're around and Masaki Oya certainly made an impact there on that point.

637
00:45:05,531 --> 00:45:08,574
Now will that provide a spark here for Japan?

638
00:45:09,575 --> 00:45:10,135
Onodera.

639
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:16,842
Serves Leial and yeah, what an angle.

640
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:19,730
Absolutely impossible to stop that.

641
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:25,157
Oh, no, Derro was there, but Flavio just so athletic, attacking this ball at such a high point.

642
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:27,681
Another angle for that swing.

643
00:45:31,706 --> 00:45:32,127
Wallace.

644
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:34,931
17-13 in Brazil.

645
00:45:35,411 --> 00:45:36,653
Still comfortable here.

646
00:45:37,088 --> 00:45:44,123
Nice pickup by Ran Takahashi who will take that one off the block, but it'll fall nicely into the backcourt and there's another high one from Flavio.

647
00:45:44,163 --> 00:45:51,077
That's some rescue for Moira, but I think he's gone the wrong side of the antenna.

648
00:45:51,097 --> 00:45:52,600
Another terrific effort from him.

649
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:06,788
Well, it is a feature of Japan volleyball that always has been that everything comes back.

650
00:46:07,209 --> 00:46:09,712
But even he couldn't sneak that inside the antenna.

651
00:46:11,254 --> 00:46:13,797
So Wallace will now serve at 18-13.

652
00:46:14,878 --> 00:46:16,180
Nice pickup.

653
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,182
The block was even better from Flavio.

654
00:46:19,204 --> 00:46:22,067
So Ishikawa has to turn setter.

655
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:28,375
And Ran Takahashi says, thank you very much.

656
00:46:31,173 --> 00:46:33,875
Flavio with a good adjustment, but just a little bit late.

657
00:46:34,316 --> 00:46:47,708
Reaches to the hitter, and, gosh, he takes advantage of it.

658
00:46:47,728 --> 00:46:58,918
Well, they're setting up for the block here, but in order to have a chance at the block, you've got to get yourself in play, and Miara goes too long, so it's Sekita who will return at Setter.

659
00:47:00,113 --> 00:47:01,676
After getting a recharge on the bench.

660
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,331
Leal.

661
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:15,541
Where's that going?

662
00:47:15,561 --> 00:47:17,424
Too much on it.

663
00:47:17,624 --> 00:47:20,089
The overpass from Ishikawa, smashed back.

664
00:47:20,149 --> 00:47:20,890
Well, hello.

665
00:47:31,231 --> 00:47:32,973
That violation called against Brazil.

666
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:34,055
Flavio admits to it.

667
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:43,768
That's a let-off for Japan.

668
00:47:44,308 --> 00:47:48,534
Ran at Takahashi.

669
00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:51,438
With an awful lot of work to do here to get themselves back into it.

670
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:53,060
Fernando brings it near side.

671
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:59,989
Lukarelli can't get the better of Yamamoto and nor can Ishikawa get the better of Flavio.

672
00:48:00,897 --> 00:48:02,458
is sent back with interest.

673
00:48:06,022 --> 00:48:11,627
Lavio again patrolling the net so high against his hand so far over the net.

674
00:48:12,528 --> 00:48:14,189
That's exactly what Brazil wants to see.

675
00:48:20,695 --> 00:48:22,417
Well, they send young Darlan in there.

676
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:29,503
Youngster, just 20 years old, plays his club volleyball in Sao Paulo.

677
00:48:30,428 --> 00:48:31,670
Sends in a beauty.

678
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:33,392
So Ishikawa's lost that.

679
00:48:36,617 --> 00:48:40,303
Does that go in the record books as an ace, even though Yamamoto got a second touch?

680
00:48:40,323 --> 00:48:42,165
Because if it does, it does well, but it should.

681
00:48:42,366 --> 00:48:42,786
It should.

682
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:46,091
Oh, that's impact off the bench.

683
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:49,176
Darlan sends in a screamer.

684
00:48:54,544 --> 00:48:56,166
You make one step, do you say?

685
00:48:56,416 --> 00:49:11,635
You have to manage your high ball with this block.

686
00:49:11,876 --> 00:49:18,424
What do you need to work on?

687
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,725
This is how the last ten points have played out.

688
00:49:29,987 --> 00:49:31,489
Just padded their lead here, Brazil.

689
00:49:32,451 --> 00:49:36,936
And they've comfortably got this match exactly where they want it.

690
00:49:38,919 --> 00:49:41,442
And they haven't seen the last of Darlan serving either.

691
00:49:43,405 --> 00:49:49,272
A big, hitting 20-year-old sent in another zinger, Yamamoto with an absolutely superb pass, Ishikawa.

692
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,331
Good enough.

693
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:51,512
Lucas was there.

694
00:49:51,933 --> 00:49:54,936
That took plenty off that, so it didn't come screaming back there.

695
00:49:54,976 --> 00:49:57,639
That's clever from Ishikawa.

696
00:49:57,659 --> 00:49:58,500
That's a little touch.

697
00:50:00,463 --> 00:50:03,386
Lucas just sending it out of bounds.

698
00:50:03,406 --> 00:50:07,431
Side out, but Japan needing an awful lot here.

699
00:50:10,855 --> 00:50:11,556
Yamachi.

700
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:16,241
Side out.

701
00:50:18,604 --> 00:50:19,545
He knows where...

702
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:22,977
heading into set three with Japan two sets down.

703
00:50:24,218 --> 00:50:27,162
That says an incredible meltdown here from Brazil.

704
00:50:32,347 --> 00:50:33,929
Fernanda skims the net.

705
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:39,675
That's picked up by Rand Takahashi, who will now drive through straight into the block and back.

706
00:50:40,976 --> 00:50:45,140
A trademark Takahashi pipe attack meets a wall of yellow.

707
00:50:46,942 --> 00:50:49,785
And there's only one winner.

708
00:50:51,487 --> 00:50:53,550
Lucas says, are you really bringing it here?

709
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:54,271
Really?

710
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:55,392
You taking me on?

711
00:50:56,214 --> 00:50:56,995
Get out of here.

712
00:50:58,537 --> 00:51:00,420
Sakita, that's the stretch.

713
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,543
Ishikawa stretch, does he drop it on the line?

714
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:05,006
No, he does not.

715
00:51:05,046 --> 00:51:06,648
Set point, Brazil.

716
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:13,538
Just the wrong side of the line.

717
00:51:18,565 --> 00:51:21,409
Fernando looking to wrap it up right here.

718
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:23,519
Can't do it.

719
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:29,706
That's Japan facing an overwhelming odds.

720
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:32,629
17-24 down.

721
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,832
They do have Nashida back there to serve.

722
00:51:36,073 --> 00:51:40,578
He's always got an ace in him, but he needs seven devastating serves in a row.

723
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,902
Well, picks that one up.

724
00:51:43,922 --> 00:51:45,664
Wallace wraps it up.

725
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:46,665
No, he doesn't.

726
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,848
That takes the net cord, not a touch.

727
00:51:51,157 --> 00:51:54,242
thought at first that had taken a touch, but no, that skimmed off the net cord.

728
00:51:54,483 --> 00:51:55,985
So they fight one off here, Japan.

729
00:52:01,415 --> 00:52:04,179
Nishida though overheats that one, and that'll do it.

730
00:52:05,942 --> 00:52:08,867
Brazil, dominant performance in that second set.

731
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:15,679
Not letting Japan get a sniff, grabbed the initiative early and never let their opponents get anywhere near them.

732
00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:20,965
And it's a long trudge back to the sidelines for Japan.

733
00:52:20,985 --> 00:52:22,507
They were facing a real headache here.

734
00:52:22,647 --> 00:52:27,995
Brazil who trailed by two in their first match against Cuba came back to win in three.

735
00:52:28,496 --> 00:52:29,938
But it's a different outlook here.

736
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:32,762
It's the Brazilians leading by two.

737
00:52:33,823 --> 00:52:41,194
And it's Japan that are going to be thinking about the long comeback here because that was as comfortable as you like.

738
00:52:42,828 --> 00:52:49,762
They had that slow start in set one, went through the gears here, they started fast Brazil and never let Japan get a sniff.

739
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:57,897
The numbers looking like this, 12-9 attack points, the four blocks to two, the ace serve, everything really stacking up in Brazil's favour.

740
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:03,027
And all those numbers point to the same outcome.

741
00:53:03,048 --> 00:53:04,330
It's a comfortable

742
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,582
set for Brazil.

743
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:11,847
And Renan Dalzotto, who I think we will hear from momentarily, must be pretty happy with what he's seen.

744
00:53:11,867 --> 00:53:15,971
Although coaches rarely are, of course, they're always seeking perfection.

745
00:53:21,617 --> 00:53:24,399
With Brazil's head coach, Dalzotto, thank you for joining us.

746
00:53:24,439 --> 00:53:26,562
Your team is up, two sets to zero.

747
00:53:26,722 --> 00:53:28,724
Early pressure from Japan, but you've answered.

748
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,026
What's your message to the team going forward?

749
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:39,179
It's a very balanced match, because Japan is always strong in Batuta, like the first seven.

750
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,741
We made the difference in Batuta.

751
00:53:41,441 --> 00:53:55,157
We had the tranquility to support Rebeni, the attitude, knowing how to play with a high ball, but the smell is very good in defense, so this third set is very important to have the right mind to start Rebeni.

752
00:53:55,964 --> 00:53:56,686
Thank you very much.

753
00:53:56,706 --> 00:54:03,622
Good luck the rest of the way.

754
00:54:03,662 --> 00:54:06,148
Very strong from Brazil.

755
00:54:07,671 --> 00:54:11,120
They are not taking any chances at all.

756
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:14,327
It did look like the possibility that they might be

757
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:16,191
stretched here by Japan.

758
00:54:16,311 --> 00:54:26,287
It hasn't worked out that way at all and it'll be very interesting to hear what Philippe Blaine, the Japan head coach, makes of that first two sets and what he might be able to do to turn it around.

759
00:54:31,876 --> 00:54:35,501
With Japan head coach Philippe Blaine, Philippe, down 0-2.

760
00:54:35,762 --> 00:54:38,526
What are you telling your team now to start set number three in this match?

761
00:54:38,962 --> 00:54:43,827
I want to be speaking with my team right now, so I will go to speak with them.

762
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,550
So, yeah, Brazil is being good, serving good.

763
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:49,553
The defense much better at the beginning of the match than usual.

764
00:54:50,094 --> 00:54:59,224
So, now we have to find a side out to a more efficient, to have a chance to come back into the games and to try to make our defense more offensive.

765
00:54:59,604 --> 00:55:05,471
Thank you for the time, Coach.

766
00:55:05,491 --> 00:55:06,792
So, look at the spike velocity.

767
00:55:55,844 --> 00:56:05,436
The numbers for Uando Leal, who's been a silver medal winner in the world championship back in the day with his native Cuba, a naturalised Brazilian, of course.

768
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:23,860
Ishikawa off the bench has come in and contributed seven attack points, but it's the Japan attack that has really been blunted through these first two sets and rare for Philippe Blaine,

769
00:56:24,717 --> 00:56:29,921
to not have an awful lot to say there, but what can you say after Brazil's performance?

770
00:56:29,941 --> 00:56:37,768
A little bit more to say than maybe he wanted, but he wanted to get back to his team and prepare them to start set number three.

771
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,390
He's got to find that magic.

772
00:56:40,851 --> 00:56:53,762
Whatever they had in the beginning of set number one, to get out to that early 3-0 lead, those two three-point leads that they had in set number one, it's kind of escaped them, but Brazil really found themselves in every aspect of the game.

773
00:56:54,316 --> 00:56:55,998
and has been playing very strong ever since.

774
00:57:05,146 --> 00:57:07,328
They have been whispers around the world of volleyball.

775
00:57:07,348 --> 00:57:08,989
I mean, it's not just you and me, Matt.

776
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:21,541
There's a little whiff of Brazil, perhaps not being where they once were after that quarterfinal exit in the volleyball nation's league and the Japan on the upswing, but this doesn't look like a meeting of one team on the way up and one team on the way down to me.

777
00:57:21,561 --> 00:57:22,382
No, it certainly doesn't.

778
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:23,783
I mean, Brazil has responded.

779
00:57:24,488 --> 00:57:29,996
And especially after being down two games to Nunn, to Cuba, and coming back to win the next three.

780
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,099
To a good position here.

781
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,722
Yeah, that really has given them a jolt.

782
00:57:33,802 --> 00:57:38,309
Four sets they've won in a row, and they'll be well on course for five here, you would think.

783
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,273
Fernando gets them back in system.

784
00:57:41,293 --> 00:57:45,319
Again, defensively really good from Rantaka, Hashid Nishida.

785
00:57:45,339 --> 00:57:47,302
No, that's going to go out.

786
00:57:47,322 --> 00:57:51,829
Well, if they can get their outside hitters firing, they've got a chance.

787
00:57:54,745 --> 00:57:57,329
They need Nishida, we've been saying it all match long.

788
00:57:57,389 --> 00:58:00,194
He had a great start, was very quiet in set number two.

789
00:58:00,855 --> 00:58:05,663
But that could be a good sign, especially the sign that Japan needs here in set three.

790
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:15,158
Haven't seen much of a big old Felipe Roque so far.

791
00:58:18,424 --> 00:58:19,926
Number 21 for Brazil.

792
00:58:20,716 --> 00:58:23,239
Oh, nice fake, but they don't buy the fake.

793
00:58:23,259 --> 00:58:26,562
That's good defending from Japan, and they're going to need to do some more though, and they can't get it.

794
00:58:27,383 --> 00:58:27,903
Can't get it.

795
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:34,490
Lucas just so long.

796
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,552
Look where Fernando set that ball from.

797
00:58:37,253 --> 00:58:40,456
All in the way, nearly at the sideline.

798
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:41,657
What is it about?

799
00:58:41,777 --> 00:58:42,618
What is it about Lucas?

800
00:58:42,658 --> 00:58:46,762
Everyone keeps saying, well, he's going to start to, his skills will start to erode at some point.

801
00:58:46,782 --> 00:58:47,443
He's 36.

802
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:49,525
There's no sign of it at all.

803
00:58:52,340 --> 00:59:00,048
Yeah, Nishida gets the better there of Leal, who didn't really have much of an opportunity to do much about that.

804
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:04,793
Leal so far inside to start that block move, and then he goes wide like that.

805
00:59:06,675 --> 00:59:07,896
Takes one right off the forehead.

806
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,684
Nishida drills it, it's another nice ace.

807
00:59:15,164 --> 00:59:15,985
Perfect.

808
00:59:18,952 --> 00:59:22,055
And Nishida off to a very hot start here in set number three.

809
00:59:22,415 --> 00:59:24,057
Two kills and a service ace.

810
00:59:28,361 --> 00:59:31,544
Yesotales just look at that and say, ah, no, he's got another one.

811
00:59:35,287 --> 00:59:37,749
And they do come in bunches with Eugene Nishida.

812
00:59:39,491 --> 00:59:40,672
He won't hold back on this one.

813
00:59:41,132 --> 00:59:41,693
Drilled it.

814
00:59:41,893 --> 00:59:42,934
Really nice pick up that.

815
00:59:44,095 --> 00:59:46,157
The crosscourt from Wallace doesn't work.

816
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:54,091
And Chicago goes for a bit of finesse, a bit of football from Fernando, but no.

817
00:59:54,111 --> 00:59:55,273
They're not going to let him have that.

818
00:59:55,393 --> 00:59:57,355
Got to appreciate the effort there from Fernando.

819
00:59:58,717 --> 01:00:04,924
Got the ball up on that first contact, but watch it go straight into Wallace's chest that has to go over.

820
01:00:04,964 --> 01:00:09,329
Fernando's got to work on his football skills a little bit.

821
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:11,731
Listen, if you're Brazilian, you know how to use your feet.

822
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:13,073
That's a given.

823
01:00:19,398 --> 01:00:21,083
They made a fast start in set one.

824
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:22,267
Got picked back.

825
01:00:24,393 --> 01:00:25,737
What Brazil need is a side out.

826
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:28,044
Get this guy out of the service rotation.

827
01:00:28,445 --> 01:00:29,408
Get him out of there.

828
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,212
Tales picks that up.

829
01:00:32,252 --> 01:00:33,374
It's a really nice pass.

830
01:00:33,394 --> 01:00:37,421
Fernando goes back side with the set and Wallace finishes the job.

831
01:00:37,441 --> 01:00:40,566
Really, really good pass from Tales.

832
01:00:40,646 --> 01:00:41,989
Oh, it was an amazing pass.

833
01:00:42,209 --> 01:00:50,383
And then this swing from Wallace just placing it precisely right down the line for that point in a much needed side out for Brazil.

834
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:13,388
Lucas as that sent back and then it's taken off the block and away in Japan, resolutely trying to dig in here.

835
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:18,855
All smiles from Sekita as Onodara takes care of business here.

836
01:01:29,848 --> 01:01:30,529
Ishikawa.

837
01:01:48,903 --> 01:01:50,004
Wallace de Souza.

838
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,293
Nice, the angle served there.

839
01:01:57,154 --> 01:01:59,457
Ryan Takahashi runs into the block.

840
01:01:59,477 --> 01:02:00,519
He'll have another go here.

841
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,021
The containing block is there.

842
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:04,404
He gets the better of it, but Wallace is there to keep it alive.

843
01:02:04,424 --> 01:02:06,767
Luka Relly sets it up and lay it off.

844
01:02:06,787 --> 01:02:09,350
Takes it off and Ishida's attempted dig.

845
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:12,835
Ishida in retrospect, maybe should have left that alone, but...

846
01:02:13,405 --> 01:02:15,908
It's his touch, sends it out, and they back come Brazil.

847
01:02:16,569 --> 01:02:22,596
Wallace doing a great job to keep this ball alive in the set from Luccarelli to his teammate.

848
01:02:25,439 --> 01:02:26,901
They all get that point.

849
01:02:26,921 --> 01:02:28,703
Pretty sure that was dropping in there anyway.

850
01:02:28,843 --> 01:02:30,145
He had to try and make a play at it.

851
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,211
Wallace.

852
01:02:35,832 --> 01:02:39,460
down the line to Takahashi Nishida is wiped out.

853
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,803
Absolutely wiped out.

854
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:41,725
Was that Flavio?

855
01:02:41,785 --> 01:02:42,948
Was it Luccarelli?

856
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:43,910
Brazil don't care.

857
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:45,633
They'll take another stuff block.

858
01:02:47,518 --> 01:02:48,881
Leal with the right hand.

859
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:52,288
Keeping it over just long enough to get that block point.

860
01:02:58,867 --> 01:03:01,791
It's going to take blocks now for Brazil.

861
01:03:04,054 --> 01:03:05,156
I think he's put too much on that.

862
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:08,240
Yeah, around Takahashi.

863
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,181
Sends that too deep.

864
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:26,325
Well, they've made the strong start, but they've been overhauled by Brazil already here in Japan.

865
01:03:31,537 --> 01:03:34,561
We have to find solution of it, huh?

866
01:03:34,581 --> 01:03:34,942
Okay?

867
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:39,028
Sometime or so, using push or, huh?

868
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:42,633
You can use many things, working with, huh?

869
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:43,775
There you go.

870
01:03:43,795 --> 01:03:46,078
But we don't forget fight, also.

871
01:03:46,158 --> 01:03:58,776
We don't play so much, so we can go, we can go, but we don't fight.

872
01:04:13,775 --> 01:04:14,596
Off the timeout.

873
01:04:15,056 --> 01:04:17,038
Here comes Wallace, Brazil 6-5.

874
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,101
Serving Yamamoto.

875
01:04:20,902 --> 01:04:23,124
Sent back side, Nishida takes it off the block.

876
01:04:24,906 --> 01:04:27,569
Side out.

877
01:04:27,589 --> 01:04:30,672
Lael knows he's very close to getting a block on Nishida.

878
01:04:31,213 --> 01:04:35,257
But you can see him reach back in and Nishida just targets the forearm and goes out of bounds.

879
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:39,281
As you say, he knows.

880
01:04:39,341 --> 01:04:41,263
That's a couple of inches.

881
01:04:41,923 --> 01:04:43,545
And he's got himself another block point.

882
01:04:44,993 --> 01:04:47,016
Fine margins, always is in this game.

883
01:04:48,898 --> 01:04:54,065
That's a pretty soft serve coming in from Onadira, who's got underneath that somehow, that is some rescue.

884
01:04:56,027 --> 01:04:59,872
And then nothing doing there for Takahashi, who's denied at the baseline, and then a block.

885
01:05:00,433 --> 01:05:07,542
Oh, it's gone out, it's spun away from Yamachi, thought he'd got himself a block point there, and it just took that wicked spin off court.

886
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:13,576
Leal scoring his 13th point of the match and he is not showing any signs of slowing down.

887
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:18,923
Taking swing after swing, scoring points for his side.

888
01:05:27,152 --> 01:05:32,078
Leal, some of a zinger, nicely collected, Brian Takahashi.

889
01:05:32,817 --> 01:05:35,844
No winner for him, but always kind of swing at that.

890
01:05:35,924 --> 01:05:36,565
Would you believe it?

891
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,470
You know, Andy Leal from a mile back.

892
01:05:39,432 --> 01:05:41,296
And now Brazil will look to transition.

893
01:05:41,657 --> 01:05:42,819
Set it up on the inside.

894
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,104
Brilliant from Ishikawa back.

895
01:05:45,124 --> 01:05:46,327
He can't keep it in play.

896
01:05:46,588 --> 01:05:47,670
And they're just being...

897
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:49,950
Overworked here, Japan.

898
01:05:50,091 --> 01:05:54,799
I mean, so strong defensively, but Brazil just keeps sending the heavy hitters out there, Adam.

899
01:05:54,819 --> 01:05:59,266
Well, Leal wanted that one and Fernando knows who the hot hitter is.

900
01:06:00,068 --> 01:06:01,110
He's setting Leal.

901
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:13,050
No matter where he is on the court, he's taking a swing at it.

902
01:06:23,408 --> 01:06:29,619
That's a tough one for Sekita to deal with, yeah.

903
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:30,461
We'll do this one again.

904
01:06:36,031 --> 01:06:40,258
That's good to see the referee taking responsibility of that.

905
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:43,003
I'm sorry guys, can we do this one again please?

906
01:06:43,287 --> 01:06:48,985
bit quick on the whistle, wanted to call the double, but realized that Lukarelli was playing it back to his own side.

907
01:06:49,908 --> 01:06:51,473
Players don't mind that.

908
01:06:52,135 --> 01:06:53,098
Everybody makes a mistake.

909
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:57,111
He put his hands up, said, yeah, that's on me, and everyone's just going to get on with it.

910
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:18,182
Leal at 86 into the net.

911
01:07:23,618 --> 01:07:26,727
Just trying to stick around here, Japan, and service errors will help.

912
01:07:38,823 --> 01:07:41,267
Tales with a perfect service reception.

913
01:07:41,387 --> 01:07:42,850
No winner there though for Flavio.

914
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:45,154
This time they've contained that in comes Ishikawa.

915
01:07:45,174 --> 01:07:46,115
Does he catch the line?

916
01:07:46,135 --> 01:07:48,279
And the answer to that is no, he does not.

917
01:07:50,282 --> 01:07:52,666
Well, Ishikawa missed that opportunity.

918
01:07:52,706 --> 01:07:58,296
Flavio reaches to the right side and Ishikawa misses to the wrist away.

919
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:00,600
You're playing Brazil.

920
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,603
Those are the kind of shots you've got to have.

921
01:08:04,405 --> 01:08:10,813
Flavio serving Yamamoto, an easy take for him and an easy put away for Yamachi, uncontested.

922
01:08:22,929 --> 01:08:27,915
Japan not utilizing their middles a lot in this match so it's good to see them get a point here and there.

923
01:08:32,688 --> 01:08:36,171
Again, really nice pick up there from Lukarelli, who will get third touch on this.

924
01:08:36,311 --> 01:08:38,793
Ooh, did that take anything on the way through?

925
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:41,996
They're saying no, and immediately Lukas is saying, you challenged that.

926
01:08:42,276 --> 01:08:43,758
Lukas had big eyes on that.

927
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,882
Yeah, as soon as the challenge came in, Japan admitted to the touch.

928
01:08:52,445 --> 01:08:58,971
We'll see the replay here, but right there off the pinky.

929
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:01,193
Yeah, Yamachi saying, yeah, that's on me.

930
01:09:03,755 --> 01:09:06,739
Fernando.

931
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:10,565
10-8 Brazil.

932
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:13,089
He's mixing his serves up.

933
01:09:13,109 --> 01:09:14,811
Sakita sends it over to Ishikawa.

934
01:09:14,852 --> 01:09:16,754
That's picked up by Fernando down the line.

935
01:09:16,794 --> 01:09:19,078
This will be Luccarelli looking at this one.

936
01:09:19,138 --> 01:09:20,620
And I think he's overheated that one.

937
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,401
That goes wide.

938
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:29,914
Luccarelli just missing the sideline there as well.

939
01:09:33,387 --> 01:09:38,371
There's just enough misses and service errors from Brazil to keep Japan within touching distance here.

940
01:09:41,534 --> 01:09:45,718
But then Yamachi has got to make sure his serves go in, especially when it's as soft as that.

941
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,502
And he doesn't need anyone to tell him that.

942
01:09:57,909 --> 01:09:59,410
Lukarelli then, 11-9.

943
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:00,752
Got to be side out Japan.

944
01:10:01,012 --> 01:10:02,213
Just got to dig in here.

945
01:10:03,138 --> 01:10:04,640
Stay close, Sekita under.

946
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:08,184
Intense pressure feeds Nishida and that won't drop their weight.

947
01:10:09,425 --> 01:10:10,666
Well, it was all service reception.

948
01:10:10,726 --> 01:10:12,128
The pass was not perfect.

949
01:10:12,148 --> 01:10:18,495
Sekita did well just to give Nishida any kind of play at all, but the defenders were just lining up.

950
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:22,980
Yeah, Leal finally getting that one off of Nishida that he missed earlier.

951
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:28,386
And Sekita a little frustrated with this setting location there after that play was over.

952
01:10:30,205 --> 01:10:33,309
Luccarelli at 12-9 Brazil.

953
01:10:38,236 --> 01:10:40,459
Takahashi picking that one up.

954
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:41,721
Now, has Nishida got that?

955
01:10:41,861 --> 01:10:42,762
No, he hasn't.

956
01:10:42,782 --> 01:10:43,483
He hasn't.

957
01:10:44,765 --> 01:10:49,331
I think this match has just gone away from Japan, just in these last two points.

958
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:50,432
Just a little off the net.

959
01:10:50,492 --> 01:10:53,617
Nishida trying to make something of it, but just misses the inline.

960
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:56,240
Nishida out.

961
01:10:56,941 --> 01:10:59,925
Kento Miara in for Japan.

962
01:11:06,571 --> 01:11:10,635
Lukarelli serving at 13-9, desperately needed side out here for Japan.

963
01:11:10,655 --> 01:11:11,756
Two of them going for that one.

964
01:11:13,038 --> 01:11:20,946
Yamamoto setting from way, way, way back and Fernando sets up the pipe attack and that is just drilled by Lukarelli.

965
01:11:20,966 --> 01:11:24,690
And again, Japan in disarray on their service reception and they've paid for it.

966
01:11:26,392 --> 01:11:30,216
Lukarelli just hammers that ball into that open seam.

967
01:11:44,219 --> 01:11:45,881
Lukareli serving Yamamoto.

968
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:47,764
Sekita has to move around a little bit.

969
01:11:47,824 --> 01:11:56,995
Miara has to take a very, very clever swing at that because the blockers were lining up to send that back and he's been very creative with his swing.

970
01:11:57,015 --> 01:12:01,040
Yeah, nice off-speed shot there from the opposite that just came in.

971
01:12:05,346 --> 01:12:07,489
Brunos living every point there, isn't he, on the bench?

972
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:14,057
So Miara opening his account off the bench.

973
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:19,737
That's all he's going to have for his tally after he comes up with a service error.

974
01:12:19,757 --> 01:12:21,659
Brazil with such a comfortable lead here.

975
01:12:37,661 --> 01:12:38,022
Clever.

976
01:12:39,744 --> 01:12:40,385
Nishikawa.

977
01:12:41,246 --> 01:12:42,508
Yeah, very clever indeed, Nick.

978
01:12:42,528 --> 01:12:44,230
Nishikawa changing up the pace.

979
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:49,899
Placing it precisely past the block of Wallace.

980
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:01,943
Well, how they would like a couple of aces here from Yuki Ishikawa.

981
01:13:04,207 --> 01:13:05,830
For now, there's got some work to do there.

982
01:13:06,839 --> 01:13:09,704
not the greatest of service receptions, and can they get themselves out of it?

983
01:13:09,724 --> 01:13:14,893
They can because he lay out, you know, and lay out with great touch and depth on that swing.

984
01:13:15,054 --> 01:13:16,276
Just lay out having a match.

985
01:13:16,296 --> 01:13:17,738
That's his 16th point.

986
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:22,888
And finally showing that he can change the pace up a little bit and still be effective.

987
01:13:26,594 --> 01:13:27,075
Wallace.

988
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,163
Talis has got that off the floor somehow.

989
01:13:35,223 --> 01:13:36,145
Goodness only knows how.

990
01:13:36,165 --> 01:13:40,031
Oh, that is a perfect push.

991
01:13:40,051 --> 01:13:40,772
Luke Corelli.

992
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:43,957
Goodness me.

993
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:48,664
It's your fans' blockers deciding not to let's lay all their hands out.

994
01:13:48,684 --> 01:13:49,425
Luke Corelli, excuse me.

995
01:13:52,991 --> 01:13:54,974
Everything going the way of Brazil now?

996
01:13:55,454 --> 01:13:55,915
That's OK.

997
01:14:04,484 --> 01:14:07,650
You can see from the body language, he knows this.

998
01:14:08,692 --> 01:14:10,095
There's no way back from this.

999
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,904
Six point deficit here in set number three.

1000
01:14:15,465 --> 01:14:17,970
Brazil really playing some strong volleyball.

1001
01:14:19,182 --> 01:14:23,246
Until Yoandil Leal, who had that last point, not look great as I incorrectly picked up.

1002
01:14:23,286 --> 01:14:25,928
You said it earlier, he's just having one of those games.

1003
01:14:25,989 --> 01:14:29,492
I mean, he's seeing everything big and slow and everything he's attempting.

1004
01:14:29,912 --> 01:14:31,714
It just happens like that somehow for you as a player.

1005
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:37,600
Everything drops into place and it really has been working for Yoandil Leal today and the last 10 points.

1006
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,542
I mean, it's been a wipeout.

1007
01:14:40,923 --> 01:14:47,009
Yeah, Brazil, behind the efforts of Leal, really up their level, just firing on all cylinders.

1008
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,430
Everybody has contributed.

1009
01:14:49,793 --> 01:14:54,399
with stood the pressure from the inline for Japan and come right back with their own.

1010
01:15:02,249 --> 01:15:03,370
By Patak.

1011
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:04,251
Drilled that, Thales.

1012
01:15:05,853 --> 01:15:12,181
By Ishikawa, who will actually come through the net, just to make sure that the Brazil libero is okay.

1013
01:15:12,562 --> 01:15:12,962
He is.

1014
01:15:16,306 --> 01:15:17,708
What are the dangers of

1015
01:15:19,274 --> 01:15:20,597
Standing that close.

1016
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:23,685
Tal is getting that one right off of the chin.

1017
01:15:26,493 --> 01:15:28,478
He's going to take a second just to gather himself.

1018
01:15:30,162 --> 01:15:31,185
But smiles all around.

1019
01:15:31,525 --> 01:15:32,929
Yeah, he's OK. Part of the game.

1020
01:15:49,902 --> 01:15:51,424
Too big a hit from Wallace.

1021
01:15:52,686 --> 01:15:57,494
It's the consistency of the hitting from Wallace and from Luca Raleigh, and of course we talked about Yoendi Layal.

1022
01:15:57,514 --> 01:16:01,881
I mean, not been too many unforced errors from that gang of three this afternoon.

1023
01:16:04,605 --> 01:16:05,667
Ayres have been very limited.

1024
01:16:05,967 --> 01:16:07,810
Layal, Wallace, Luca Raleigh.

1025
01:16:24,682 --> 01:16:26,344
Takahashi tries to be clever.

1026
01:16:27,205 --> 01:16:28,067
It's the right idea.

1027
01:16:28,387 --> 01:16:34,475
Oh, Luccarelli improvising something there and then it's all gone wrong for Ishikawa.

1028
01:16:35,016 --> 01:16:37,219
Luccarelli trying to run a quick attack there.

1029
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:44,108
He's seen Lucas do it for so long you wanted to get in on that action when Flavio wasn't there with the misconnection.

1030
01:16:44,982 --> 01:16:47,586
You know, it's good to see Japan smiling and seeing the funny side.

1031
01:16:47,606 --> 01:16:52,413
This actually sets up a huge third match for them in the pool phase against Cuba.

1032
01:16:53,034 --> 01:16:55,958
I mean, they've got to get something out of that, or they could face elimination.

1033
01:16:57,681 --> 01:17:11,682
Yeah, a nice little push there from Ran Takahashi.

1034
01:17:22,715 --> 01:17:25,299
That's crashing it down there wasn't it Flavio?

1035
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:30,226
You know maybe falling two sets behind a Cuban is exactly what this Brazil squad needed.

1036
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:39,600
You know they came in after and by their stands that indifferent volleyball nation's league they fall two down and everyone starts looking at them and I think they looked at themselves and said no no no we're better than this.

1037
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:43,365
But since then they've just been inspired.

1038
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:47,351
Character moment for sure and perhaps it's carried over into this match.

1039
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:50,055
I mean this is going to be a statement victory for them that

1040
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:52,835
Everybody else in the world championships is going to take note of.

1041
01:17:54,197 --> 01:17:54,658
Darlan.

1042
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:57,362
We know what he can do from the service line.

1043
01:17:57,503 --> 01:17:58,424
It's another beauty.

1044
01:17:58,825 --> 01:18:10,244
Ran Takahashi picks it up, but when you're setting from there, you're asking for trouble, and sure enough, there is very little chance for Takahashi there as Miara was setting all the way back to our commentary position there.

1045
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,027
It's impossible.

1046
01:18:12,614 --> 01:18:14,518
Very compromised situation for Japan.

1047
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:17,082
Setting the ball from that far off the court.

1048
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,886
This is some weapon to bring off the bench.

1049
01:18:19,527 --> 01:18:20,188
This really is.

1050
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:22,312
I'll tell you, Darlan.

1051
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:24,316
Darlan's bringing it when he serves.

1052
01:18:27,241 --> 01:18:28,243
There goes another one in it.

1053
01:18:28,263 --> 01:18:29,706
This is devastating.

1054
01:18:29,726 --> 01:18:31,089
Absolutely devastating.

1055
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:32,952
Wow, what a serve.

1056
01:18:38,872 --> 01:18:40,594
Oh, that had everything.

1057
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:46,440
Fly, spin, power, direction.

1058
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:51,766
Tomio Miro Yamamoto could not deal with it at all, and there wouldn't have been many players in the world who could.

1059
01:18:53,487 --> 01:18:55,349
Darlan looking for another big one.

1060
01:18:55,369 --> 01:18:56,410
That's way too big.

1061
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:02,817
But hey, that's job done.

1062
01:19:03,518 --> 01:19:05,120
That's another really good cameo.

1063
01:19:06,161 --> 01:19:08,423
Yeah, he gets the other boys on the bench.

1064
01:19:09,685 --> 01:19:15,491
And Brazil, three points from wrapping this thing up.

1065
01:19:15,511 --> 01:19:16,171
Takahashi.

1066
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:19,234
Picked up by Leal.

1067
01:19:19,975 --> 01:19:21,396
Lukarelli.

1068
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:22,117
No, that's nice.

1069
01:19:22,437 --> 01:19:24,660
From Ran Takahashi, Ishikawa.

1070
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,842
No, that's picked up by Yoandil Leal.

1071
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:30,605
And then they block him, but the block goes out.

1072
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:32,747
So Wallace will claim himself another winner.

1073
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:38,613
Miara was certainly there, one of a gang of three from Japan, and they could not keep it in play.

1074
01:19:38,713 --> 01:19:39,574
And Brazil,

1075
01:19:40,853 --> 01:19:42,515
Moved to within two points.

1076
01:19:52,606 --> 01:19:53,748
Fernando serving at 23-14.

1077
01:19:54,769 --> 01:19:56,150
What a professional job.

1078
01:19:56,771 --> 01:20:00,035
Renan Balzotto's squad have performed this afternoon.

1079
01:20:02,878 --> 01:20:06,422
It was a match you thought potentially could have been fraught with danger for Brazil.

1080
01:20:07,448 --> 01:20:12,274
and they've turned it into a comfortable straight sets victory.

1081
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:19,863
You can't even say Japan have played particularly badly, but Brazil have really brought it today.

1082
01:20:22,446 --> 01:20:24,809
And so Yamachi with a little flash of defiance.

1083
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:33,760
Well, that's all it is.

1084
01:20:42,312 --> 01:20:43,654
Gavacci with serve.

1085
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:45,177
Thales picks that up.

1086
01:20:46,379 --> 01:20:48,282
And that's another one for Wallace.

1087
01:20:49,264 --> 01:20:57,198
And that brings up an awful lot of match points.

1088
01:21:01,726 --> 01:21:06,514
The longer it's gone on, there is a chasm has opened up between these two teams.

1089
01:21:07,726 --> 01:21:13,171
The Japan are staring down the barrel of a pretty comprehensive straight sets defeat here.

1090
01:21:15,814 --> 01:21:18,457
Lukarelli.

1091
01:21:18,477 --> 01:21:22,421
Sekita manages to set up Miara, and he's found himself a winner there.

1092
01:21:24,062 --> 01:21:27,986
Oh, Kento Miara.

1093
01:21:28,006 --> 01:21:30,148
Forcing Lukarelli to make a decision here.

1094
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:30,869
Does he leave it?

1095
01:21:30,889 --> 01:21:31,710
Does he go for it?

1096
01:21:33,492 --> 01:21:34,813
And he decided to go for it.

1097
01:21:36,008 --> 01:21:41,207
That delays the moment.

1098
01:21:41,227 --> 01:21:47,571
Miara will be lining up to serve once we've got the moisture cleaned off the floor.

1099
01:22:08,054 --> 01:22:10,487
Yara serves Thales, that could be an overpass.

1100
01:22:10,507 --> 01:22:20,140
Fernando has somehow rescued it one-handed and Lucas puts it away and that point right there sums up Brazil's quality.

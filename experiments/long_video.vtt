WEBVTT

00:03.946 --> 00:08.061
What a start, what a start.

00:08.082 --> 00:10.250
I mean you can't do it any better than that.

00:10.310 --> 00:14.867
That's one way to start a match up with a clean ace between Luca Raleigh and Talis there.

00:16.973 --> 00:17.934
There's the old story.

00:17.954 --> 00:21.878
If you can split two of them, they either both go for it, or at night of them go for it.

00:21.898 --> 00:22.579
They both leave it.

00:22.859 --> 00:23.600
That's what he got there.

00:23.620 --> 00:24.842
And they both had to go for that one.

00:24.862 --> 00:26.223
It's another beautiful serve.

00:26.864 --> 00:28.405
That'll get picked up by Yamamoto.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.507
He'll do a lot of that.

00:29.547 --> 00:32.049
And then Nishida pops up far side.

00:32.109 --> 00:33.030
That's contained.

00:33.351 --> 00:36.714
Fernando will set up the Piper tag.

00:36.734 --> 00:38.797
And that's a bit of a surprise.

00:40.959 --> 00:42.741
Oh, that pushed too long.

00:42.981 --> 00:43.682
Two attacks.

00:44.062 --> 00:45.664
No kills yet for Brazil.

00:47.534 --> 00:54.164
down 0-2 here very early on, but not perhaps the greatest start that the Brazilians were looking for.

00:55.085 --> 00:56.147
Yeah, Luca really pushing it.

00:57.509 --> 00:58.591
Nishida with another ace.

00:58.871 --> 01:00.834
And again, he's got both of them going for it.

01:00.994 --> 01:04.840
I mean, his lasers are fine-tuned here.

01:05.100 --> 01:07.324
He's dropping it between two players every time.

01:07.364 --> 01:08.005
Here's another one.

01:08.305 --> 01:11.951
Nishida is just so strong, this time attacking the seam of Leal and Thales.

01:13.834 --> 01:16.798
His second ace of the match and just three serves.

01:19.428 --> 01:21.190
Now, Philly Blaine is saying, you carry on like that.

01:21.210 --> 01:22.512
Let's have another 22 like that.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.160
Well, is he going to fight with another one?

01:28.180 --> 01:30.022
No, he's not.

01:30.042 --> 01:32.085
That's a job done by Eugene Nishida.

01:32.445 --> 01:34.929
Devastating burst of serving to open up this match.

01:37.132 --> 01:40.556
Side out, we'll see Lucas Suck come back there.

01:40.576 --> 01:42.759
He won this competition back in 2010.

01:44.802 --> 01:45.503
Still going.

01:50.056 --> 01:54.443
It's easier to say what Lucas Sackkamp hasn't had a major medal in.

01:54.463 --> 01:56.507
I mean, he's got the full set.

01:56.527 --> 02:00.534
His resume is extremely long and very decorated.

02:00.754 --> 02:04.921
And club and international level opens up with a long serve.

02:04.961 --> 02:07.305
Japan with the early jump here.

02:11.015 --> 02:15.400
Not Suka serving Luccarelli, who just about deals with that.

02:15.420 --> 02:17.282
That's Wallace with no real play on there.

02:17.302 --> 02:21.827
A little whiff there, I think, in the middle from Onadira, and they pay for that.

02:21.947 --> 02:23.689
Yohendi Leal says that's enough of that.

02:25.931 --> 02:29.255
That's an attack matchup that's advantage to Brazil.

02:29.996 --> 02:36.803
Leal attacking against Sekita, the smaller setter, but that time Leal goes hard cross court for the winner.

02:38.335 --> 02:42.983
So Wallace, another one of these veterans with serve.

02:43.003 --> 02:43.744
It's a nice take.

02:44.025 --> 02:44.566
Look out.

02:44.926 --> 02:47.511
Eugene Nishida absolutely rips it down there.

02:47.531 --> 02:54.062
I mean, that's Thales who gets everything back in the backcourt for Brazil, but that was just too hot even for him to handle.

02:55.004 --> 02:57.728
Nishida off to a brilliant start here.

02:58.450 --> 03:00.934
That's his third point of the match.

03:09.048 --> 03:10.890
The net serve from Aladira, side out.

03:17.899 --> 03:24.647
Leal.

03:27.731 --> 03:28.312
Oh, nice.

03:28.793 --> 03:29.333
Nice.

03:29.353 --> 03:31.576
Hey, they need a kick start.

03:31.596 --> 03:34.880
Maybe Joanne Leal can provide it.

03:34.900 --> 03:38.785
Well, Brazil gets an ace back this time from Leal, challenging that seam.

03:39.305 --> 03:41.908
Yamamoto, we should have taken that one.

03:44.751 --> 03:47.454
So Leal looking to level it up here for Brazil.

03:47.694 --> 03:53.400
And he does with another ace and a completely different serve that's swirled away from Ran Takahashi.

03:53.420 --> 03:56.964
Well, this is outstanding serving from Yande Leal.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.146
And this is one of the hardest balls to pass.

03:59.286 --> 04:02.570
Straight at you, actually going away from Ran to his line.

04:03.671 --> 04:06.855
Line to line serve from Leal for another ace.

04:06.875 --> 04:09.177
It's been a while since we've had a hat trick of aces.

04:10.945 --> 04:12.066
And we're going to have to wait again.

04:12.947 --> 04:17.533
It's a much better take from Ran Takahashi who comes up with third touch as well.

04:17.573 --> 04:21.357
And it's a perfect one right at the feet of the back row defender.

04:21.557 --> 04:26.864
Great pass leads to great in-system offense and Ran Takahashi attacking against Fernando.

04:27.324 --> 04:29.126
That's advantage Japan all match long.

04:32.030 --> 04:33.511
Masahiro Sakita, the setter.

04:34.713 --> 04:36.615
Oh, he's found a nice.

04:38.924 --> 04:43.070
I mean, Sakita's not known for his devastating serving, but sometimes it's about placement.

04:43.410 --> 04:50.059
It doesn't have the power that Nishida has, but the placement is equally as effective through the seam and deep into the court.

04:52.362 --> 04:54.325
The ace is coming thick and fast in this match.

04:55.186 --> 04:57.710
Fernando goes for the quick inside second.

04:57.750 --> 05:00.053
That's Flavio flying high there.

05:00.073 --> 05:01.895
Flavio, which is so athletic.

05:02.376 --> 05:04.299
Works hard to get around, Fernando.

05:05.580 --> 05:07.463
Running that drift pattern.

05:08.455 --> 05:14.924
floats away from the center and opens up that wrist away angle for the point.

05:14.944 --> 05:18.228
Zekita with the forward inside set, that doesn't work.

05:18.288 --> 05:29.383
So we'll have another go here with Yamauchi and they contain that Brazil and now they look to transition with Luccarelli ripping it off the block and Brazil starting to go through the gears here now after that slow start.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.667
Now the Brazilian squad has to get momentum behind them, right?

05:33.687 --> 05:40.276
Nishita started this match out with some quality serving, but Luca Raleigh getting a chance to get activated in the front row.

05:40.536 --> 05:42.879
Scores on that first attack.

05:42.899 --> 05:44.541
Flavio stays on serve.

05:44.561 --> 05:45.062
No, he doesn't.

05:45.122 --> 05:45.562
Side out.

05:45.943 --> 05:47.485
Sends that on a little bit too deep.

05:47.505 --> 05:50.829
Both teams have been very, very aggressive with their serves, which you like to see.

05:52.491 --> 05:55.335
But it means you will get some deep long serves.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.457
You'll get some net serves.

05:56.537 --> 05:59.060
Here is Iran, Takahashi.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.602
21 in a few days time.

06:02.759 --> 06:03.921
full of youthful energy.

06:04.342 --> 06:06.647
Again, it's a really nice pick up on Luca Rally.

06:07.128 --> 06:10.174
Full of energy at 30 years old as well.

06:10.194 --> 06:13.841
Part of the Olympic gold medal winning score for Brazil.

06:13.861 --> 06:14.923
That'll be a fun matchup.

06:15.264 --> 06:20.174
Luca Rally hitting against Nishita and vice versa, obviously.

06:20.194 --> 06:22.438
Luca Rally winning that first challenge.

06:28.038 --> 06:32.845
Fernando plays his club volleyball in Italy for Monza with serve.

06:32.865 --> 06:40.655
That's picked up off the floor and that'll go out to Nishida who tries a little bit of finesse and the block was there to contain it and goes for a big power swing instead this time.

06:40.675 --> 06:42.278
And again, Talis can't deal with it.

06:42.298 --> 06:45.402
That's two that Nishida has zipped past the Brazil libero.

06:45.762 --> 06:47.124
Now Luca's got stuck at the net.

06:47.144 --> 06:48.066
It's the only blocker.

06:48.126 --> 06:53.092
Nishida sees the alley and flushes that ball off the libero.

06:56.958 --> 06:57.859
Here a Yamauchi.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.166
It's picked up by Thales.

07:06.688 --> 07:10.252
And the lovely angle taken there on the crosscourt from Luca Relli.

07:10.272 --> 07:16.859
Now, Luca Relli had ankle all day to attack as that Suka drifted past the antenna on this move.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.923
Luca Relli knows exactly what to do with that set.

07:30.635 --> 07:32.757
Oh, my goodness, what a pick up that was.

07:33.530 --> 07:55.082
So that's going to be collected by Luccarelli backcourt and hello Well, you won't see that too often Lucas are come straight into the net This opportunity there is Lucas got a great deflection On his block however the connection between him and Fernando Not firing there

07:57.728 --> 08:00.341
Nishida, and it's another sizzler it really is.

08:00.382 --> 08:01.688
That's sent backwards.

08:01.728 --> 08:06.372
Luccarelli setting from about five metres behind the back line.

08:07.415 --> 08:08.777
but they do keep it in play.

08:08.817 --> 08:11.542
Now Sekita has options and he'll send it to Otsuka.

08:11.562 --> 08:13.264
That doesn't come up with a winner either.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.086
This could be trouble.

08:14.887 --> 08:20.196
Yohan Delayal almost taking the head of Rantakashi off there, but he's kept it in play.

08:20.216 --> 08:22.079
And then they come up with the winner as well.

08:22.399 --> 08:24.442
That's typical Japan defense.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.985
Just send everything back.

08:26.045 --> 08:32.916
Yeah, great defense in the backcourt from Japan after a strong serve again from the inline.

08:34.685 --> 08:36.327
Both teams working really hard.

08:36.807 --> 08:37.768
Here's another dig.

08:38.389 --> 08:39.330
Just back over the net.

08:39.510 --> 08:40.591
Keep the rally going.

08:41.672 --> 08:43.154
Lukareli has to step in and set.

08:43.294 --> 08:45.777
And it's a block that catches Wallace on the way out.

08:50.862 --> 08:52.223
That's a big bonus for Japan.

08:58.930 --> 08:59.391
Nishida.

08:59.711 --> 09:01.053
No.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.754
Brazil, very happy to see that one go long.

09:02.774 --> 09:03.375
Yeah, they are.

09:04.992 --> 09:08.335
Deep Saira leave, saying that she'd have missed that serve.

09:12.359 --> 09:15.642
Lucas at 10-11.

09:20.146 --> 09:31.557
Sekid has to scramble around and Otsuka has done really well because the three-man block had all data get set there and bad things could have happened but Tatsunori Otsuka rubbed it off the block an hour.

09:32.617 --> 09:54.338
Japan escaping this one a great serve from Lucas to the corner and then a really well-formed three-man block, but Japan gets the side out Another really good serve Talies has to hoist that one up there and Luke Carelli Can't get a winner, but Yamamoto setting from behind his baseline and somehow that's been shoveled over goodness only knows how

09:55.415 --> 09:57.519
Yoendilay, I can't find a winner, Sekita.

09:57.919 --> 10:00.484
As they go back in the system and did that catch the line?

10:00.504 --> 10:01.546
No, it did not.

10:01.586 --> 10:03.068
Otsuka goes too long.

10:03.108 --> 10:06.173
That's a missed opportunity, Japan.

10:06.374 --> 10:07.075
Yeah, it certainly is.

10:08.357 --> 10:11.022
Otsuka just misses the contact.

10:11.923 --> 10:19.336
Trying for the corner, but it was just long.

10:19.356 --> 10:19.937
Wallace.

10:30.970 --> 10:47.993
He's put a little bit too much under that one as well.

10:48.033 --> 10:50.256
That really caught a thermal on the way over the net, didn't it?

10:50.296 --> 10:51.738
A bit of a tail in on that one.

10:52.339 --> 10:53.721
Pushed it way out of bounds.

11:01.497 --> 11:08.508
Uandy Leal, the Cuban born outside hitter, zings that one too deep and we're getting a rash of service errors now.

11:09.991 --> 11:13.697
Part of the reason for that is both these sides know you can't play safe at this level.

11:14.378 --> 11:15.259
You've got to do something.

11:15.279 --> 11:18.484
The borrow was set early on with two aces.

11:19.686 --> 11:20.808
And a response from Brazil.

11:20.828 --> 11:22.611
Now the service pressure continues.

11:23.198 --> 11:28.690
Sakita's serve is picked up by Leal, Fernando has to scramble around and that allowed the block to get set.

11:28.710 --> 11:32.198
And you know what, that might have been Ran Takahashi getting the final touch on that one.

11:32.659 --> 11:36.988
That's a real bonus for Japan if Ran is getting block points.

11:39.095 --> 11:40.076
That is him as well.

11:40.376 --> 11:43.299
This ball has got to get covered by either Flavio or Lael.

11:43.319 --> 11:45.341
They're both standing there, watching it hit the floor.

11:46.462 --> 11:48.544
Hey, hey, let's get together here.

11:48.965 --> 11:51.047
Hey, let's get together here.

11:51.067 --> 11:54.691
The first thing is to hit two of them.

11:54.711 --> 11:57.313
To the miss, don't let go of the line.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.675
She can't let you go out, okay?

11:58.815 --> 12:00.737
To the left, on top of the line.

12:00.757 --> 12:01.898
He's marking the hand for him.

12:01.978 --> 12:03.279
It's a good marking.

12:03.559 --> 12:04.040
Keep it there.

12:04.480 --> 12:04.721
Okay?

12:04.741 --> 12:05.421
Get out of there.

12:05.582 --> 12:07.143
I'm going to close the Miolo of the block.

12:07.443 --> 12:09.085
Leave the risk for them.

12:09.065 --> 12:20.839
Well, here's what's happened in the last 10 points.

12:21.419 --> 12:23.362
Japan have opened up a nice healthy lead again.

12:28.067 --> 12:30.630
There's such an air of confidence about this Japan squad.

12:30.650 --> 12:36.557
We saw it in the volleyball nations league early this year and they went to the quarter-final stage, which was their best result.

12:37.212 --> 12:40.637
You know, they hosted their own Olympics, got to the quarterfinals there.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.782
They're suddenly banging on the door of being a top, top contender now.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.070
Ooh, did Flavio get anything on that?

12:49.090 --> 12:51.033
No, he did not get a touch on the way through.

12:54.058 --> 12:57.283
Well, so far the middle attackers for Brazil not finding the court.

12:59.686 --> 13:02.190
Flavio trying for the hard angle, but missing wide.

13:06.220 --> 13:17.074
Sekita's serve is not particularly well handled, but the down the line from Wallace is an absolutely drill that Yamamoto, who just has to send it spinning off at a crazy angle.

13:17.214 --> 13:21.600
The set from Fernando and Wallace able to turn that one hard down the line.

13:24.584 --> 13:27.648
So that'll set up Flavio, Brazil with points to make up here.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.333
Sekita will pick that up nicely.

13:31.752 --> 13:41.446
Nishida is also picked up by Wallace in the backcourt there and now Wallace can try and scuff that one over and how many touches are they going to have?

13:41.466 --> 13:50.318
Bit unlucky for Japan that time it was a good block move they got some hands on that attack as well just not able to play it cleanly out of the net

13:57.082 --> 13:59.385
Flavio serving Otsuka.

14:00.527 --> 14:02.090
Nice from Miyamachi.

14:02.190 --> 14:05.355
Good execution.

14:05.375 --> 14:06.636
Well, that all started with the pass.

14:07.458 --> 14:11.364
Japan hasn't been able to run their middles very much, but they got a perfect pass and system that time.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.687
They score the point through the middle.

14:13.707 --> 14:15.951
Brian Takahashi.

14:15.971 --> 14:20.878
Well, graduated from college, went straight into the Italian League, playing for Padua.

14:22.732 --> 14:23.773
Boom.

14:23.793 --> 14:25.736
Joanne Leal sends that back with interest.

14:25.756 --> 14:26.737
He's in Italy as well.

14:26.757 --> 14:30.662
We'll be with Pierre Chinz the next season.

14:30.682 --> 14:32.725
Just a perfectly timed, big attack.

14:32.765 --> 14:34.727
You see both blockers jumping on Lucas.

14:36.029 --> 14:39.413
Leal can take care of that one all day long.

14:39.433 --> 14:40.755
So Brazil staying close here.

14:41.135 --> 14:42.717
Fernando can get him a bit closer.

14:43.658 --> 14:48.064
He's getting a nice pass, but an even better block from Lucas.

14:48.820 --> 14:52.114
Lucas was just one of the best middle blockers in the world.

14:52.214 --> 14:53.098
So experienced.

14:53.539 --> 14:54.323
What a reaction.

14:54.805 --> 14:58.560
Just gets his hands up and over the net and the monster block.

15:04.666 --> 15:06.752
So Fernando looking to level this one up.

15:06.772 --> 15:08.297
Good response, this from Brazil.

15:08.317 --> 15:10.263
That's got to be good and is.

15:10.283 --> 15:12.530
I tell you what, Suga's found the corner there beautifully.

15:12.610 --> 15:13.934
Just clipping that baseline.

15:14.175 --> 15:16.281
Yeah, Suga's had a good start to this match.

15:16.943 --> 15:19.350
It's his third point here in this opening set.

15:20.663 --> 15:24.488
Yeah, he's the guy that's in the starting line-up with Ishikawa on the bench, the captain.

15:25.349 --> 15:38.385
We saw Ishikawa come off the bench against Kata, and I know you were talking to Coach Philippe Blaine earlier in the week, and he alluded to just the management of some niggling injuries for Ishikawa, so they're not gonna work him too hard this early in the tournament.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.288
It is all about managing your players through a tournament like this.

15:45.754 --> 15:49.438
So whether we see Ishikawa or not remains to be seen.

15:49.621 --> 15:52.305
What he's not ready to be, obviously, is a workhorse at the moment.

15:52.825 --> 15:56.150
And that means others can step up like Otsuka.

15:58.253 --> 15:59.515
Yamachi with serve.

15:59.975 --> 16:00.516
That's gone.

16:03.420 --> 16:07.105
Now, Fernando and Lucas communicating to each other after that play.

16:07.446 --> 16:14.355
Lucas asking for a little bit of a higher set, perhaps, but this time he's able to score the point.

16:14.976 --> 16:17.940
Listen, if Lucas is asking for something, Lucas is going to get it.

16:20.570 --> 16:23.773
drilled by Lukarelli, kept alive.

16:24.113 --> 16:27.577
Nishida with a clever push, Talies with the pancake to keep it alive as well.

16:27.597 --> 16:32.021
And then the cross call from you, and now is perfect.

16:32.061 --> 16:35.565
The Brazil offensive, Jung and Orton is starting to go through the gears here.

16:36.465 --> 16:41.150
But what a save to keep that ball alive by the back row player for Brazil.

16:41.851 --> 16:46.375
Tied at 18-all and Japan decides to use a timeout.

16:47.857 --> 16:50.560
It's OK.

16:52.102 --> 16:54.565
It will be a fight at TGM.

16:54.585 --> 17:00.212
We don't forget nothing about the coverage, about everything ready for this.

17:01.214 --> 17:01.274
OK?

17:02.696 --> 17:06.360
All right, good.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.582
Don't close, huh?

17:07.602 --> 17:08.663
At TGM, we don't close fight.

17:08.683 --> 17:10.405
And you keep fighting.

17:10.605 --> 17:11.847
High and low.

17:11.867 --> 17:12.508
OK?

17:12.528 --> 17:13.609
All right, go.

17:16.653 --> 17:16.733
TGM!

17:19.987 --> 17:21.930
Philippe Blaine keeping it simple.

17:23.192 --> 17:24.674
It's another good response from Brazil.

17:24.694 --> 17:27.799
That's twice Japan have had a lead in this match, right at the beginning of course.

17:27.899 --> 17:31.985
And they had a healthy looking one at the midpoint of this set.

17:32.045 --> 17:34.809
Only to see Brazil comes charging back at them.

17:39.136 --> 17:40.678
Let's see what Luca Relli can do here.

17:49.130 --> 17:50.171
picked up off the floor.

17:51.572 --> 17:53.113
Nishida is blocked out of it.

17:53.194 --> 17:56.396
That's a wonderful one-handed dig from Ran Takahashi.

17:56.436 --> 17:59.159
And it's just got to be pushed over there from Otsuka, who covered a lot of ground.

17:59.179 --> 18:02.522
But him coming for another dig from Takahashi.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.224
And then he's just blocked out of it, though, is Otsuka.

18:06.705 --> 18:08.087
Great defense from Brazil.

18:08.127 --> 18:08.927
They're all round.

18:09.027 --> 18:10.909
Great defense from Japan.

18:10.949 --> 18:12.931
Great blocking from Brazil.

18:14.112 --> 18:15.193
Could have gotten the first one.

18:15.213 --> 18:18.816
But Wallace comes through with a huge block this time on Otsuka.

18:20.247 --> 18:22.310
scoring the point and finishing off that rally.

18:26.317 --> 18:32.026
Natsuka will sit down as Ishikawa will come in.

18:32.046 --> 18:33.589
That's probably not a surprise.

18:36.133 --> 18:38.577
We knew we were going to see him at some point in this match, Nick.

18:42.657 --> 18:45.240
and they go straight after the new player, as you would, of course.

18:45.741 --> 18:49.666
You'll have a chance at swinging at this, and he just runs into the block, but there's too much on it.

18:49.726 --> 18:54.552
The block can't control it, so Ishikawa announces his arrival onto court in style.

18:59.659 --> 19:07.669
First swing of the match, off the bench comes in and blasting it off of Lucas' hands, and out of balance.

19:09.134 --> 19:11.117
He's looking for it every time, using the sheet.

19:11.798 --> 19:13.380
He's not looking at containing serves.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.863
He's looking to put the pressure on every time.

19:16.003 --> 19:20.729
He has the green light, as we say, to get after it as hard as he can every single time.

19:23.974 --> 19:27.979
Lucas, 2019, with a little net skimmer from him.

19:28.019 --> 19:29.721
Sekita sends it to Ishikawa.

19:29.741 --> 19:34.247
That one's going to fall perfectly, perfectly for Yohande Layal.

19:35.037 --> 19:38.762
Sometimes you need a bit of luck, and I'll tell you, you're in Leal at that on a plate.

19:38.963 --> 19:50.039
Well, Wallace isn't going to get credit for the block, but the deflection is just as good as it goes right to Leal, and he cleans it up.

19:50.059 --> 19:55.727
Lucas, Brazil going through the gears and put themselves in a good position here.

19:55.747 --> 20:00.193
That was Ishikawa running into the containing block, but that's better.

20:00.213 --> 20:01.795
Fernando would love to have that one back.

20:01.876 --> 20:04.960
It got past the block, and I don't think Fernando was expecting that.

20:06.408 --> 20:08.112
Oh, Fernando kind of charges in.

20:11.059 --> 20:12.403
Catches him up high.

20:13.606 --> 20:17.074
But a missed defensive opportunity that time.

20:17.094 --> 20:21.164
Japan still looking for the point on serve to get him back level.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.269
Ishikawa.

20:23.857 --> 20:25.940
serves Leal, who handles that one perfectly.

20:26.020 --> 20:27.742
We looked at what an angle.

20:27.763 --> 20:29.144
What an angle he took there.

20:29.164 --> 20:32.469
I mean, Takahashi was there to cover it, but just couldn't get a play on that at all.

20:32.529 --> 20:33.130
It was too good.

20:33.571 --> 20:37.276
This angle, challenging the middle, blasting it past the left hand.

20:38.337 --> 20:41.362
An extreme angle from Leal on the left side here.

20:41.682 --> 20:43.625
Yeah, Ranzakashi's got that cover.

20:43.645 --> 20:44.306
He read it all the way.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.848
You just couldn't do anything with it.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.437
Wallace, another powerful serve.

20:49.457 --> 20:50.459
That'll go inside.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.063
Wallace picks that up on the dig.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.185
Fernanda goes back side.

20:53.325 --> 20:56.051
Long crosscourt sat there to Luca Relli.

20:57.513 --> 21:00.039
And Fernanda, oh, just a bit out of sync there.

21:00.059 --> 21:00.960
Will it get away with it?

21:01.061 --> 21:01.862
Yeah, Flavio.

21:02.103 --> 21:03.125
No, it's still going.

21:05.169 --> 21:08.275
Well, that's Japan's scrambling defense at its best.

21:08.845 --> 21:14.112
But in the end, it's a really clean cross-court kill from Yohande Leal that ends that rally.

21:14.372 --> 21:16.035
Yeah, a great swing on the right side.

21:16.455 --> 21:21.662
Some chaos throughout that play, but Leal getting stuck on the right side because they switched their blockers.

21:22.123 --> 21:24.206
Fernando went to the left, Leal to the right.

21:24.246 --> 21:26.509
That's why he's attacking on the right side on the counter attack.

21:28.872 --> 21:33.418
This might just be a catch of breath time out.

21:33.871 --> 21:37.978
So, both sides, they make pressure outside the block.

21:37.998 --> 21:38.799
That's my king.

21:38.819 --> 21:42.184
So, you should be ready for taking this, huh?

21:42.385 --> 21:51.800
Hey, we tried to come to a quick, a quick, a quick pipe and open side.

21:51.820 --> 21:58.410
Ah, because big, it was working so much.

22:05.208 --> 22:10.075
Now Brazil's offense is starting to heat up in the later stages of the set number one now.

22:11.017 --> 22:14.823
And the blocking of Japan has got to get a little tighter.

22:15.644 --> 22:17.146
Not a lot of three-man blocking.

22:17.867 --> 22:20.351
And that wing blocker comes off to play defense.

22:20.371 --> 22:24.077
But if they're not going to block, they've got to play some solid defense behind the two-man blocker.

22:35.903 --> 22:37.405
Well, can Japan come back from this?

22:39.428 --> 22:43.113
First to 25, remember, with a two-point margin.

22:45.736 --> 22:47.519
So Wallace looking to take it to set point.

22:48.681 --> 22:49.642
That's a nice pick-up.

22:51.104 --> 22:53.647
And there we go, game banner block.

22:53.667 --> 22:57.793
I'll tell you, Flavio with Leal alongside him just wiping out Nishida.

22:57.993 --> 23:00.276
Now we're going to see a challenge here come in from Japan.

23:00.316 --> 23:07.483
That block had so much pace behind it off of Flavio, but it catches the sideline for sure.

23:07.503 --> 23:10.487
It looks like on that replay.

23:10.507 --> 23:12.749
But when it's set point, you might as well chuck a challenge down.

23:13.991 --> 23:19.957
I agree with you.

23:19.997 --> 23:21.299
That looked like it caught plenty.

23:23.921 --> 23:24.422
Yeah.

23:26.731 --> 23:28.594
That's one of those, what the heck challenge is, isn't it?

23:28.614 --> 23:30.677
Well, I mean Japan has to challenge that one.

23:31.498 --> 23:33.441
It's a good challenge at this stage of the set.

23:38.288 --> 23:38.869
Set point then.

23:40.511 --> 23:43.195
Wallace looking to serve it out, that slow start from Brazil.

23:43.456 --> 23:48.042
A distant memory here, side out, but Japan will need three points on their own serve.

23:48.563 --> 23:51.287
They'll switch it up and bring in Kento Miyada.

23:58.979 --> 24:02.324
There's a precious situation for Miara.

24:02.945 --> 24:03.506
Off the bench.

24:03.966 --> 24:05.168
Come on, save three set points.

24:10.676 --> 24:12.839
It's a decent effort with the first one.

24:12.859 --> 24:16.865
Somehow, Lucarelli's got under it along with Thales, and he's well off net there, Yoandilay.

24:16.885 --> 24:19.368
And still finds a clean winner.

24:19.429 --> 24:22.874
I mean, Brazil just powering their way through that set the longer it went on.

24:23.074 --> 24:28.041
And from a slow start, Brazil started to crank it up, and once they did,

24:28.021 --> 24:32.185
Covered that second lead that Japan had they, but they won that set pulling away.

24:32.246 --> 24:35.970
Yeah, they found themselves down by three points twice in this opener.

24:35.990 --> 24:55.851
But once they regained the lead, it didn't give it up and lay out with a huge swing here to finish off set number one high off the hands.

24:57.586 --> 24:58.827
That's as sweet as you like.

24:58.867 --> 25:01.130
And Renan Dalzotto says, that's how we do it.

25:01.170 --> 25:02.091
That's how we roll.

25:05.615 --> 25:08.198
So a slow star, but a very strong finish.

25:08.459 --> 25:10.261
Brazil securing the first set.

25:10.281 --> 25:11.803
25 to 21.

25:11.923 --> 25:17.810
And this is how they did it by the numbers.

25:18.010 --> 25:21.594
Three to two blocks, five aces with three going to Japan.

25:22.375 --> 25:26.800
The attack points very heavily favoring Brazil.

25:29.378 --> 25:34.046
Great block in defense and great serving in that opener.

25:35.228 --> 25:38.573
Setting the table for what was expected to be a very exciting match, Nick.

25:38.633 --> 25:42.720
And can't really complain about that first set from both sides.

25:42.780 --> 25:55.521
Good quality volleyball all the way around.

26:00.074 --> 26:01.576
So placement for Brazil.

26:03.540 --> 26:04.541
Looking like this.

26:04.561 --> 26:17.543
A little more heavy to that left side of the court going after that front row outside hitter that's got to pass.

26:31.765 --> 26:39.577
And for Japan, looking like this.

26:43.102 --> 26:58.465
Once the big hitter's got into that stride, Wallace and Leal, in particular, Lukarelli.

27:00.638 --> 27:05.483
Throw in a couple of blocks, and the Brazil juggernaut.

27:05.503 --> 27:14.113
After a couple, a little bit of a shaky start for Brazil, they found themselves, Leal scoring nine points in that opening set.

27:14.213 --> 27:19.899
Nishita with two aces right at the start of the set, didn't contribute, wasn't able to contribute very much after that.

27:21.081 --> 27:25.525
Now only two attack points for Nishita through set one, two service ace points.

27:28.148 --> 27:29.650
Defensively they did a number on him,

27:31.840 --> 27:34.967
Whenever Nishida did try to attack, there's always a two-man block.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.130
He didn't get any one-on-ones.

27:44.128 --> 27:45.351
That was an exciting opener.

27:45.712 --> 27:49.140
Let's hope set number two is equally as exciting here.

28:04.628 --> 28:09.113
It'll be Fernando to get this second set underway.

28:12.837 --> 28:16.260
Yamamoto picks that up, then Mishita can't get the better of Thales.

28:16.861 --> 28:17.842
Backside it goes.

28:18.663 --> 28:23.028
Neat, neat as you like for Wallace DeSousa, dropping into the feet of the back row defender there.

28:23.809 --> 28:27.793
Wallace is just so deceptive on his attacking from the right side.

28:27.893 --> 28:32.678
Faces angle, but has that whip of an arm that can turn it right back down the line.

28:37.163 --> 28:39.567
Fernando does bring a bit of spite to his serves.

28:41.029 --> 28:45.556
She takes everything off that one, so Keita can go back side and the Sheeter again is blocked out of it.

28:46.077 --> 28:51.185
So it's scramble time for Japan and they almost scrambled something rather good out of that from Ishikawa.

28:52.988 --> 28:53.488
Oh dear.

28:54.730 --> 28:55.652
That's a big miss.

28:56.072 --> 28:57.435
That's a really big miss.

28:57.455 --> 28:59.678
Taishi Onodira won't want to see a replay of this.

29:00.957 --> 29:04.326
Now, Brazil not happy with that no call on that third ball over.

29:04.387 --> 29:06.412
That was clearly a double contact.

29:06.492 --> 29:07.094
Great effort.

29:08.458 --> 29:15.979
This is the contact that they're not happy with, but an attack through the middle from Japan results in that hitting air.

29:23.536 --> 29:25.598
Fernando drills it.

29:25.618 --> 29:26.599
It's another strong serve.

29:26.619 --> 29:28.080
He's mixing up his serves really well.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.224
Ishikawa picked it up, but his third touch wasn't particularly devastating.

29:31.244 --> 29:35.648
And the block, I tell you, Taishi Onodera gets some redemption there for the earlier miss.

29:35.988 --> 29:37.470
The stuffed block, straight back.

29:39.492 --> 29:41.514
Lugarelli couldn't get it past the block this time.

29:42.274 --> 29:47.299
A nice move by Japan, and the left hand there, shutting it down for the monster block.

29:47.379 --> 29:48.200
Well over the net.

29:49.161 --> 29:52.024
Perfectly executed block move there from the middle.

29:53.185 --> 29:53.766
Nishida.

29:56.932 --> 29:58.375
Oh, that's not a great take at all.

29:58.896 --> 30:00.098
Somehow that's been rescued.

30:00.799 --> 30:06.690
Tough to get a winner from there, but they are still trying to put something aggressive on it, and then Nishida does finish the job.

30:07.191 --> 30:08.974
It all went wrong on service reception there.

30:09.014 --> 30:14.164
Anytime it goes careering off in the direction of your coach and the bench, it's not good.

30:20.894 --> 30:22.837
So Ishida restoring parity.

30:23.778 --> 30:25.460
2-2, set two.

30:30.167 --> 30:32.250
Oh, I tell you, that's another huge swing.

30:33.451 --> 30:35.094
Somehow, they all got enough underneath it.

30:35.815 --> 30:36.796
Wallace just has to shut.

30:36.816 --> 30:37.837
Oh, that's a bonus.

30:37.857 --> 30:38.859
What a bonus that is.

30:38.879 --> 30:42.824
I tell you, Sakita and Ishikawa are not happy about something here.

30:43.645 --> 30:50.715
Now the horn went off right after the serve was hit.

30:50.965 --> 30:53.568
Bit of a mystery buzzer going off.

31:00.376 --> 31:10.327
Yeah, it doesn't help anybody, does it?

31:10.347 --> 31:12.950
I mean, it's the old cliche, this hands-off you play to the whistle.

31:12.990 --> 31:15.893
Well, that was the equivalent of the whistle.

31:19.501 --> 31:22.231
Now coach Felipe Lane has a legitimate argument.

31:24.018 --> 31:25.905
He wants a replay, but he's not going to get it.

31:27.451 --> 31:27.591
Nope.

31:27.812 --> 31:28.615
The point stands.

31:29.177 --> 31:30.422
It is 3-2 Brazil.

31:33.085 --> 31:38.073
Luccarelli with a hot one around Takahashi, picks it up nicely, Nishida rips through.

31:38.994 --> 31:41.739
Somehow that has gone into the net and Leal's recovered.

31:41.919 --> 31:45.885
Oh my goodness, Luccarelli with the swing of the match so far.

31:46.226 --> 31:48.649
That looked like a dead ball completely.

31:48.669 --> 31:53.036
Somehow they've reacted and what a way to finish the rally from Luccarelli.

31:56.241 --> 31:57.563
That's off the charts, good.

31:58.565 --> 31:59.346
What a play.

32:07.375 --> 32:08.236
Lukareli again.

32:08.917 --> 32:10.299
Slappy angle served there.

32:10.559 --> 32:13.343
Yamamoto has done well to pick up, and the blocks worked out.

32:13.423 --> 32:17.308
Once again, Lukas celebrates sending that one back.

32:17.368 --> 32:19.611
Lukas and Wall is pairing up nicely that time.

32:19.691 --> 32:27.562
And Japan just can't find the rhythm with their left side attacker.

32:29.184 --> 32:35.813
Forced them to call a timeout here early and set to.

32:36.974 --> 32:37.736
Something was good.

32:39.702 --> 32:42.850
Remember, when the opponent is playing good, go slowly.

32:42.870 --> 32:44.655
Keep the ball a little bit higher.

32:45.157 --> 32:51.895
Keep it stronger, high, long, and you can cover, and you can keep the ball working.

32:52.077 --> 33:00.967
He knows these players very well.

33:01.367 --> 33:06.032
He was the assistant to Yuiichi Nakagaiichi for four years.

33:06.092 --> 33:10.017
He's been there for a number of years.

33:15.202 --> 33:18.726
When Nakagaiichi decided to call it a career and retire,

33:19.263 --> 33:27.494
And Philippe Blaine was the obvious upgrade in terms of just moving him up from the staff to the head job for the Japan Federation.

33:28.515 --> 33:37.787
Sekita has to travel there, and Ishikawa doesn't really get a great touch on him, but it was enough sneaky stuff there to get the better of the block.

33:37.807 --> 33:42.874
Yeah, Brazil working hard to get three blockers up after that great serve from Lukarelli, but...

33:43.647 --> 33:46.370
Japan a bit lucky on that one to go off the block and down.

33:46.570 --> 33:49.233
Yeah, hopefully Blaine's face told the story.

33:49.493 --> 33:51.095
Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.

33:53.217 --> 33:53.878
Ishikawa.

33:55.159 --> 33:56.681
Whoa, close, close.

33:58.543 --> 34:00.925
Look long.

34:00.945 --> 34:01.766
But not very long.

34:01.986 --> 34:04.269
Not very long and nearly a touch of a layout.

34:10.355 --> 34:12.237
Lucas at 6-3 Brazil.

34:15.085 --> 34:17.288
Ishikawa with a lovely pass.

34:19.051 --> 34:27.863
Really well kept up there by Lucas off the block and away, but they'll scramble this back somehow, hoisted up there by Sekita, free ball Brazil.

34:27.963 --> 34:28.984
Where are they going to go with it?

34:29.425 --> 34:30.086
A far side.

34:30.326 --> 34:31.047
Thank you very much.

34:31.127 --> 34:33.070
See you later, says Wallace de Souza.

34:33.090 --> 34:37.296
Yeah, Wallace going with that fast set inside.

34:37.596 --> 34:40.941
Look at that contact point, well over the block and down.

34:44.313 --> 34:45.295
Bruno says golf clap.

34:46.838 --> 34:47.319
He approves.

34:48.301 --> 34:50.224
If he approves, it must have been good.

34:53.150 --> 34:55.514
Lucas drilling it at Ram Takahashi.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.636
His pass is terrific.

34:57.257 --> 34:59.642
And he gets the benefit of third touch as well.

34:59.682 --> 35:02.828
Lovely pass there from Ram Takahashi.

35:12.190 --> 35:26.453
Ran just gets the one-on-one against Wallace Japan still got some damage to repair here on Adera Up next

35:30.061 --> 35:33.246
Another big power for Swing through there from Yo-Ni-Le-Ao.

35:33.266 --> 35:35.288
Sekita's had to cover an awful lot of ground there.

35:35.369 --> 35:37.752
And that's a really nice take.

35:37.772 --> 35:39.855
Ran Takahashi off the block and away.

35:40.416 --> 35:42.559
But Sekita's getting all the credit for that.

35:42.599 --> 35:44.942
The ground he covered there to make that set.

35:45.163 --> 35:46.264
And the bump set too.

35:47.045 --> 35:49.829
That Ron can attack high off the hands and score.

35:49.849 --> 35:58.161
They needed that point in Japan.

35:59.980 --> 36:01.482
back within touching distance here.

36:01.923 --> 36:03.766
Onadera will stay on serve.

36:04.627 --> 36:08.534
Fernando sends it near side and Yondele Al just rips that crosscourt.

36:08.634 --> 36:11.859
Just nothing that Ishikawa could do about that.

36:12.660 --> 36:18.089
Leal against Seketa and Leal will win that challenge every single time.

36:19.932 --> 36:21.955
So much speed behind that attack.

36:30.524 --> 36:32.026
Wallace finds nothing but Nylon.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.363
So that'll be Sekita back to the service line.

36:50.850 --> 36:53.233
Did find an ace earlier, but that one's not going to be an ace.

36:53.914 --> 36:54.855
That's going to be Iced.

36:55.476 --> 36:56.177
Wallace.

37:00.865 --> 37:03.768
Wallace comes right back with a huge swing out of the back row.

37:04.909 --> 37:06.510
So much line for him to attack.

37:07.871 --> 37:09.553
Takes advantage of it.

37:09.573 --> 37:11.295
Well, that's an illustration of what we talked about, Matt.

37:11.315 --> 37:14.237
At this level, if you serve, it doesn't put any pressure on the opponent.

37:14.498 --> 37:15.298
That's what's going to happen.

37:15.318 --> 37:17.120
There's a serve that put pressure on the opponent.

37:17.140 --> 37:19.302
The overpass ruthlessly punished by Luccarelli.

37:25.268 --> 37:26.909
And Brazil just panning their lead here.

37:28.250 --> 37:30.012
And Yamamoto sending it back.

37:30.768 --> 37:32.051
Look really so.

37:32.071 --> 37:32.532
We don't want it.

37:33.375 --> 37:37.284
Get rid of that.

37:37.304 --> 37:42.718
So Lael will serve into the net.

38:01.396 --> 38:02.998
Tales picks that one up.

38:03.018 --> 38:04.139
Fernando covers some ground.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.581
Lucarelli with the clever push.

38:05.601 --> 38:07.103
Yamamoto does manage to get there.

38:07.143 --> 38:09.866
Rishi Kaur at the three meter line is wiped out.

38:10.307 --> 38:15.152
Absolutely blown away there by Flavio, who had a long time to get himself set there.

38:15.393 --> 38:16.914
You take it from that deep off the net.

38:17.435 --> 38:18.677
You're asking for trouble.

38:18.697 --> 38:22.902
Yeah, Flavio doing a great job to get his hands over and in front of the hitter.

38:24.223 --> 38:28.348
Strong left hand there from a very veteran blocker in Flavio.

38:31.349 --> 38:36.416
who will now go to the service line and flirted with the foot fault there.

38:36.516 --> 38:43.747
But the overpass as Japan's receiving is just not at the highest level at the moment in this second set.

38:43.767 --> 38:45.129
That's two or three overpass.

38:45.209 --> 38:46.911
I think we've seen now from them in this set.

38:49.075 --> 38:51.518
And that is usually what is going to happen if you overpass.

38:52.510 --> 38:53.832
So Flavio will stay on.

38:55.214 --> 38:56.797
Yamamoto picks that one up.

38:57.979 --> 38:59.641
Lovely defensive work from Flavio.

39:01.124 --> 39:03.527
And then a big swing, but nothing doing for Wallace.

39:03.567 --> 39:04.489
It's come back somehow.

39:04.569 --> 39:08.335
So Luca Relli goes for a little bit of touch and finishes the job.

39:08.355 --> 39:11.800
So Keita was stranded mid-court, trying to get there and couldn't.

39:11.820 --> 39:14.705
Look at all these hitters coming from Brazil.

39:15.506 --> 39:16.568
Three hitters lay out.

39:16.628 --> 39:17.910
Lucas, Luca Relli.

39:18.785 --> 39:19.747
Manly the outside hitter.

39:20.368 --> 39:22.551
Places it gently to the floor for the point.

39:34.270 --> 39:36.653
Just floated down a little bit long, Flavio.

39:36.674 --> 39:45.147
But overall, Matt, you know, we're only a second and a half in, but, you know, we were talking about that little bit of that invincibility thing, maybe not there for Brazil.

39:45.498 --> 39:49.302
They breezed their way through a very good Japan team through a set and a half here.

39:49.502 --> 39:50.864
They're looking very strong right now.

39:50.884 --> 39:51.665
Really strong.

39:53.627 --> 39:56.410
Yamauchi serves Leal.

39:56.991 --> 39:58.512
He doesn't handle it particularly well.

39:59.834 --> 40:01.716
But they get something out of it thanks to Wallace.

40:05.140 --> 40:10.486
You think if you've got Luca Relli setting off court, you've got a chance if you're the defending team.

40:10.806 --> 40:13.009
But Wallace didn't give them that chance.

40:13.609 --> 40:14.290
So Fernando.

40:15.502 --> 40:16.784
We'll now serve at 14-8.

40:16.964 --> 40:19.488
Sends a short one in.

40:19.829 --> 40:20.790
Nadira picks that up.

40:21.391 --> 40:23.314
And that's more like it from Eugene Nishida.

40:23.354 --> 40:31.547
The big left-handed swing near side this time off Lucarelli and Lucas.

40:31.567 --> 40:36.595
Now Nishida, that's his first attack point of this set.

40:36.935 --> 40:40.581
Japan needs him to score for their side.

40:41.675 --> 40:46.100
Well, after that explosive start when he went off like a bottle of champagne, they just had the court taken out of it.

40:46.140 --> 40:50.925
I mean, you know, they've given him nothing, Brazil, until that moment there.

40:51.086 --> 40:59.014
Yeah.

40:59.034 --> 40:59.935
It's run on a big one.

41:00.857 --> 41:11.108
Too big.

41:19.660 --> 41:21.211
Ran Takahashi picks that up.

41:21.231 --> 41:22.258
Sekita has to travel.

41:22.822 --> 41:24.473
Ishikawa runs into the block.

41:24.925 --> 41:28.369
The block's there again as Ishikawa is off net this time.

41:29.010 --> 41:31.092
And Lukarelli comes up to set.

41:31.112 --> 41:32.774
Wallace tries to go cross-court.

41:33.034 --> 41:35.317
Sekita will now send a cross-court for Ishikawa.

41:35.417 --> 41:36.878
There's the block, but out it goes.

41:36.898 --> 41:38.780
They got three in the block.

41:38.800 --> 41:42.164
But Ishikawa, the captain, still managed to conjure up a winner.

41:42.925 --> 41:46.109
Yeah, great set, that time from Sekita all the way out.

41:46.209 --> 41:53.717
And three blockers, Leal, the last one to get there results in that attack going off his hands and then out of bounds.

41:53.697 --> 41:56.060
And Ishida and Sekita check out here.

41:58.384 --> 41:59.966
Japan look to try and mix things up.

42:00.907 --> 42:03.551
Sending out Masaki Oya, the back-up center.

42:03.591 --> 42:07.256
And Kento Miyara, the young opposite.

42:10.421 --> 42:11.122
Ishikawa.

42:12.183 --> 42:13.065
That's a clever serve.

42:14.446 --> 42:17.511
But once Lukarelli got underneath, or Leal got underneath it, should I say.

42:18.412 --> 42:21.156
It was one, two, three, finished by Lukas.

42:24.308 --> 42:28.615
Just an absolutely beautiful angle that time from Lucas on that 31 set.

43:00.792 --> 43:03.075
on Adira.

43:03.095 --> 43:04.557
Really soft serve that one.

43:04.918 --> 43:06.159
Wallace is blocked out.

43:07.521 --> 43:09.784
Yamauchi got over there.

43:09.804 --> 43:10.485
No, no, no.

43:11.346 --> 43:12.308
You're not having that one.

43:13.129 --> 43:14.631
Now Japan can celebrate that one.

43:14.671 --> 43:17.355
One of their few blocks they've gotten in this match so far.

43:17.395 --> 43:21.400
Right hand of Ron getting that block point.

43:25.750 --> 43:26.391
Onodera.

43:27.672 --> 43:28.633
Sneaky little serve.

43:28.653 --> 43:29.915
Fernando brings it near side.

43:29.955 --> 43:31.016
Leal down the line.

43:31.156 --> 43:32.137
Doesn't get a winner.

43:32.258 --> 43:33.719
Oya was there to pick that up.

43:33.739 --> 43:35.501
There's a cross call picked up by Thales.

43:35.842 --> 43:38.965
Fernando sends it inside another brilliant dig by Oya.

43:39.886 --> 43:40.827
And that's going to come over.

43:40.867 --> 43:43.971
And Fernando will set up Leal again.

43:44.011 --> 43:45.353
And he still can't get a winner.

43:45.433 --> 43:46.794
Oya with another one.

43:47.015 --> 43:47.936
I tell you something.

43:48.016 --> 43:51.560
Masaki Oya with three digs on that point.

43:52.120 --> 43:54.323
And that's outstanding defensive work.

43:56.733 --> 43:57.294
There it is.

43:57.354 --> 44:02.440
Great pick up, but Ishikawa then hammering this ball on two.

44:03.821 --> 44:04.943
Lavio made a good read.

44:07.345 --> 44:08.507
What an effort from Japan.

44:09.228 --> 44:17.998
Yeah, Ishikawa gets the credit for the kill point, obviously, but Oya dig off to dig off to dig, and now Brazil is saying, oh, we want to stop this little charge.

44:21.337 --> 44:46.819
Renan's out, Dalzotto.

44:48.161 --> 44:51.023
Sensing the momentum swing there.

44:51.577 --> 44:56.122
The old story isn't that, when you come off the bench you always want to make a mark.

44:56.182 --> 45:00.826
Let people know you're around and Masaki Oya certainly made an impact there on that point.

45:05.531 --> 45:08.574
Now will that provide a spark here for Japan?

45:09.575 --> 45:10.135
Onodera.

45:13.999 --> 45:16.842
Serves Leial and yeah, what an angle.

45:17.767 --> 45:19.730
Absolutely impossible to stop that.

45:19.750 --> 45:25.157
Oh, no, Derro was there, but Flavio just so athletic, attacking this ball at such a high point.

45:26.619 --> 45:27.681
Another angle for that swing.

45:31.706 --> 45:32.127
Wallace.

45:33.709 --> 45:34.931
17-13 in Brazil.

45:35.411 --> 45:36.653
Still comfortable here.

45:37.088 --> 45:44.123
Nice pickup by Ran Takahashi who will take that one off the block, but it'll fall nicely into the backcourt and there's another high one from Flavio.

45:44.163 --> 45:51.077
That's some rescue for Moira, but I think he's gone the wrong side of the antenna.

45:51.097 --> 45:52.600
Another terrific effort from him.

46:01.642 --> 46:06.788
Well, it is a feature of Japan volleyball that always has been that everything comes back.

46:07.209 --> 46:09.712
But even he couldn't sneak that inside the antenna.

46:11.254 --> 46:13.797
So Wallace will now serve at 18-13.

46:14.878 --> 46:16.180
Nice pickup.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.182
The block was even better from Flavio.

46:19.204 --> 46:22.067
So Ishikawa has to turn setter.

46:22.087 --> 46:28.375
And Ran Takahashi says, thank you very much.

46:31.173 --> 46:33.875
Flavio with a good adjustment, but just a little bit late.

46:34.316 --> 46:47.708
Reaches to the hitter, and, gosh, he takes advantage of it.

46:47.728 --> 46:58.918
Well, they're setting up for the block here, but in order to have a chance at the block, you've got to get yourself in play, and Miara goes too long, so it's Sekita who will return at Setter.

47:00.113 --> 47:01.676
After getting a recharge on the bench.

47:09.870 --> 47:10.331
Leal.

47:14.719 --> 47:15.541
Where's that going?

47:15.561 --> 47:17.424
Too much on it.

47:17.624 --> 47:20.089
The overpass from Ishikawa, smashed back.

47:20.149 --> 47:20.890
Well, hello.

47:31.231 --> 47:32.973
That violation called against Brazil.

47:33.053 --> 47:34.055
Flavio admits to it.

47:42.606 --> 47:43.768
That's a let-off for Japan.

47:44.308 --> 47:48.534
Ran at Takahashi.

47:48.734 --> 47:51.438
With an awful lot of work to do here to get themselves back into it.

47:51.538 --> 47:53.060
Fernando brings it near side.

47:53.100 --> 47:59.989
Lukarelli can't get the better of Yamamoto and nor can Ishikawa get the better of Flavio.

48:00.897 --> 48:02.458
is sent back with interest.

48:06.022 --> 48:11.627
Lavio again patrolling the net so high against his hand so far over the net.

48:12.528 --> 48:14.189
That's exactly what Brazil wants to see.

48:20.695 --> 48:22.417
Well, they send young Darlan in there.

48:24.979 --> 48:29.503
Youngster, just 20 years old, plays his club volleyball in Sao Paulo.

48:30.428 --> 48:31.670
Sends in a beauty.

48:32.090 --> 48:33.392
So Ishikawa's lost that.

48:36.617 --> 48:40.303
Does that go in the record books as an ace, even though Yamamoto got a second touch?

48:40.323 --> 48:42.165
Because if it does, it does well, but it should.

48:42.366 --> 48:42.786
It should.

48:43.988 --> 48:46.091
Oh, that's impact off the bench.

48:46.131 --> 48:49.176
Darlan sends in a screamer.

48:54.544 --> 48:56.166
You make one step, do you say?

48:56.416 --> 49:11.635
You have to manage your high ball with this block.

49:11.876 --> 49:18.424
What do you need to work on?

49:25.762 --> 49:27.725
This is how the last ten points have played out.

49:29.987 --> 49:31.489
Just padded their lead here, Brazil.

49:32.451 --> 49:36.936
And they've comfortably got this match exactly where they want it.

49:38.919 --> 49:41.442
And they haven't seen the last of Darlan serving either.

49:43.405 --> 49:49.272
A big, hitting 20-year-old sent in another zinger, Yamamoto with an absolutely superb pass, Ishikawa.

49:49.690 --> 49:50.331
Good enough.

49:50.571 --> 49:51.512
Lucas was there.

49:51.933 --> 49:54.936
That took plenty off that, so it didn't come screaming back there.

49:54.976 --> 49:57.639
That's clever from Ishikawa.

49:57.659 --> 49:58.500
That's a little touch.

50:00.463 --> 50:03.386
Lucas just sending it out of bounds.

50:03.406 --> 50:07.431
Side out, but Japan needing an awful lot here.

50:10.855 --> 50:11.556
Yamachi.

50:15.701 --> 50:16.241
Side out.

50:18.604 --> 50:19.545
He knows where...

50:20.875 --> 50:22.977
heading into set three with Japan two sets down.

50:24.218 --> 50:27.162
That says an incredible meltdown here from Brazil.

50:32.347 --> 50:33.929
Fernanda skims the net.

50:33.949 --> 50:39.675
That's picked up by Rand Takahashi, who will now drive through straight into the block and back.

50:40.976 --> 50:45.140
A trademark Takahashi pipe attack meets a wall of yellow.

50:46.942 --> 50:49.785
And there's only one winner.

50:51.487 --> 50:53.550
Lucas says, are you really bringing it here?

50:53.890 --> 50:54.271
Really?

50:54.451 --> 50:55.392
You taking me on?

50:56.214 --> 50:56.995
Get out of here.

50:58.537 --> 51:00.420
Sakita, that's the stretch.

51:00.440 --> 51:02.543
Ishikawa stretch, does he drop it on the line?

51:02.583 --> 51:05.006
No, he does not.

51:05.046 --> 51:06.648
Set point, Brazil.

51:12.116 --> 51:13.538
Just the wrong side of the line.

51:18.565 --> 51:21.409
Fernando looking to wrap it up right here.

51:22.958 --> 51:23.519
Can't do it.

51:24.620 --> 51:29.706
That's Japan facing an overwhelming odds.

51:31.368 --> 51:32.629
17-24 down.

51:33.130 --> 51:34.832
They do have Nashida back there to serve.

51:36.073 --> 51:40.578
He's always got an ace in him, but he needs seven devastating serves in a row.

51:42.260 --> 51:43.902
Well, picks that one up.

51:43.922 --> 51:45.664
Wallace wraps it up.

51:46.145 --> 51:46.665
No, he doesn't.

51:46.686 --> 51:48.848
That takes the net cord, not a touch.

51:51.157 --> 51:54.242
thought at first that had taken a touch, but no, that skimmed off the net cord.

51:54.483 --> 51:55.985
So they fight one off here, Japan.

52:01.415 --> 52:04.179
Nishida though overheats that one, and that'll do it.

52:05.942 --> 52:08.867
Brazil, dominant performance in that second set.

52:09.749 --> 52:15.679
Not letting Japan get a sniff, grabbed the initiative early and never let their opponents get anywhere near them.

52:16.418 --> 52:20.965
And it's a long trudge back to the sidelines for Japan.

52:20.985 --> 52:22.507
They were facing a real headache here.

52:22.647 --> 52:27.995
Brazil who trailed by two in their first match against Cuba came back to win in three.

52:28.496 --> 52:29.938
But it's a different outlook here.

52:30.358 --> 52:32.762
It's the Brazilians leading by two.

52:33.823 --> 52:41.194
And it's Japan that are going to be thinking about the long comeback here because that was as comfortable as you like.

52:42.828 --> 52:49.762
They had that slow start in set one, went through the gears here, they started fast Brazil and never let Japan get a sniff.

52:51.084 --> 52:57.897
The numbers looking like this, 12-9 attack points, the four blocks to two, the ace serve, everything really stacking up in Brazil's favour.

52:59.761 --> 53:03.027
And all those numbers point to the same outcome.

53:03.048 --> 53:04.330
It's a comfortable

53:04.900 --> 53:06.582
set for Brazil.

53:07.102 --> 53:11.847
And Renan Dalzotto, who I think we will hear from momentarily, must be pretty happy with what he's seen.

53:11.867 --> 53:15.971
Although coaches rarely are, of course, they're always seeking perfection.

53:21.617 --> 53:24.399
With Brazil's head coach, Dalzotto, thank you for joining us.

53:24.439 --> 53:26.562
Your team is up, two sets to zero.

53:26.722 --> 53:28.724
Early pressure from Japan, but you've answered.

53:29.164 --> 53:31.026
What's your message to the team going forward?

53:31.310 --> 53:39.179
It's a very balanced match, because Japan is always strong in Batuta, like the first seven.

53:39.199 --> 53:40.741
We made the difference in Batuta.

53:41.441 --> 53:55.157
We had the tranquility to support Rebeni, the attitude, knowing how to play with a high ball, but the smell is very good in defense, so this third set is very important to have the right mind to start Rebeni.

53:55.964 --> 53:56.686
Thank you very much.

53:56.706 --> 54:03.622
Good luck the rest of the way.

54:03.662 --> 54:06.148
Very strong from Brazil.

54:07.671 --> 54:11.120
They are not taking any chances at all.

54:11.801 --> 54:14.327
It did look like the possibility that they might be

54:14.729 --> 54:16.191
stretched here by Japan.

54:16.311 --> 54:26.287
It hasn't worked out that way at all and it'll be very interesting to hear what Philippe Blaine, the Japan head coach, makes of that first two sets and what he might be able to do to turn it around.

54:31.876 --> 54:35.501
With Japan head coach Philippe Blaine, Philippe, down 0-2.

54:35.762 --> 54:38.526
What are you telling your team now to start set number three in this match?

54:38.962 --> 54:43.827
I want to be speaking with my team right now, so I will go to speak with them.

54:43.847 --> 54:46.550
So, yeah, Brazil is being good, serving good.

54:46.851 --> 54:49.553
The defense much better at the beginning of the match than usual.

54:50.094 --> 54:59.224
So, now we have to find a side out to a more efficient, to have a chance to come back into the games and to try to make our defense more offensive.

54:59.604 --> 55:05.471
Thank you for the time, Coach.

55:05.491 --> 55:06.792
So, look at the spike velocity.

55:55.844 --> 56:05.436
The numbers for Uando Leal, who's been a silver medal winner in the world championship back in the day with his native Cuba, a naturalised Brazilian, of course.

56:10.743 --> 56:23.860
Ishikawa off the bench has come in and contributed seven attack points, but it's the Japan attack that has really been blunted through these first two sets and rare for Philippe Blaine,

56:24.717 --> 56:29.921
to not have an awful lot to say there, but what can you say after Brazil's performance?

56:29.941 --> 56:37.768
A little bit more to say than maybe he wanted, but he wanted to get back to his team and prepare them to start set number three.

56:39.430 --> 56:40.390
He's got to find that magic.

56:40.851 --> 56:53.762
Whatever they had in the beginning of set number one, to get out to that early 3-0 lead, those two three-point leads that they had in set number one, it's kind of escaped them, but Brazil really found themselves in every aspect of the game.

56:54.316 --> 56:55.998
and has been playing very strong ever since.

57:05.146 --> 57:07.328
They have been whispers around the world of volleyball.

57:07.348 --> 57:08.989
I mean, it's not just you and me, Matt.

57:09.029 --> 57:21.541
There's a little whiff of Brazil, perhaps not being where they once were after that quarterfinal exit in the volleyball nation's league and the Japan on the upswing, but this doesn't look like a meeting of one team on the way up and one team on the way down to me.

57:21.561 --> 57:22.382
No, it certainly doesn't.

57:22.482 --> 57:23.783
I mean, Brazil has responded.

57:24.488 --> 57:29.996
And especially after being down two games to Nunn, to Cuba, and coming back to win the next three.

57:31.198 --> 57:32.099
To a good position here.

57:32.260 --> 57:33.722
Yeah, that really has given them a jolt.

57:33.802 --> 57:38.309
Four sets they've won in a row, and they'll be well on course for five here, you would think.

57:39.050 --> 57:41.273
Fernando gets them back in system.

57:41.293 --> 57:45.319
Again, defensively really good from Rantaka, Hashid Nishida.

57:45.339 --> 57:47.302
No, that's going to go out.

57:47.322 --> 57:51.829
Well, if they can get their outside hitters firing, they've got a chance.

57:54.745 --> 57:57.329
They need Nishida, we've been saying it all match long.

57:57.389 --> 58:00.194
He had a great start, was very quiet in set number two.

58:00.855 --> 58:05.663
But that could be a good sign, especially the sign that Japan needs here in set three.

58:12.554 --> 58:15.158
Haven't seen much of a big old Felipe Roque so far.

58:18.424 --> 58:19.926
Number 21 for Brazil.

58:20.716 --> 58:23.239
Oh, nice fake, but they don't buy the fake.

58:23.259 --> 58:26.562
That's good defending from Japan, and they're going to need to do some more though, and they can't get it.

58:27.383 --> 58:27.903
Can't get it.

58:33.209 --> 58:34.490
Lucas just so long.

58:34.970 --> 58:36.552
Look where Fernando set that ball from.

58:37.253 --> 58:40.456
All in the way, nearly at the sideline.

58:40.476 --> 58:41.657
What is it about?

58:41.777 --> 58:42.618
What is it about Lucas?

58:42.658 --> 58:46.762
Everyone keeps saying, well, he's going to start to, his skills will start to erode at some point.

58:46.782 --> 58:47.443
He's 36.

58:47.683 --> 58:49.525
There's no sign of it at all.

58:52.340 --> 59:00.048
Yeah, Nishida gets the better there of Leal, who didn't really have much of an opportunity to do much about that.

59:00.949 --> 59:04.793
Leal so far inside to start that block move, and then he goes wide like that.

59:06.675 --> 59:07.896
Takes one right off the forehead.

59:11.520 --> 59:14.684
Nishida drills it, it's another nice ace.

59:15.164 --> 59:15.985
Perfect.

59:18.952 --> 59:22.055
And Nishida off to a very hot start here in set number three.

59:22.415 --> 59:24.057
Two kills and a service ace.

59:28.361 --> 59:31.544
Yesotales just look at that and say, ah, no, he's got another one.

59:35.287 --> 59:37.749
And they do come in bunches with Eugene Nishida.

59:39.491 --> 59:40.672
He won't hold back on this one.

59:41.132 --> 59:41.693
Drilled it.

59:41.893 --> 59:42.934
Really nice pick up that.

59:44.095 --> 59:46.157
The crosscourt from Wallace doesn't work.

59:47.504 --> 59:54.091
And Chicago goes for a bit of finesse, a bit of football from Fernando, but no.

59:54.111 --> 59:55.273
They're not going to let him have that.

59:55.393 --> 59:57.355
Got to appreciate the effort there from Fernando.

59:58.717 --> 01:00:04.924
Got the ball up on that first contact, but watch it go straight into Wallace's chest that has to go over.

01:00:04.964 --> 01:00:09.329
Fernando's got to work on his football skills a little bit.

01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:11.731
Listen, if you're Brazilian, you know how to use your feet.

01:00:11.792 --> 01:00:13.073
That's a given.

01:00:19.398 --> 01:00:21.083
They made a fast start in set one.

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:22.267
Got picked back.

01:00:24.393 --> 01:00:25.737
What Brazil need is a side out.

01:00:25.958 --> 01:00:28.044
Get this guy out of the service rotation.

01:00:28.445 --> 01:00:29.408
Get him out of there.

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:32.212
Tales picks that up.

01:00:32.252 --> 01:00:33.374
It's a really nice pass.

01:00:33.394 --> 01:00:37.421
Fernando goes back side with the set and Wallace finishes the job.

01:00:37.441 --> 01:00:40.566
Really, really good pass from Tales.

01:00:40.646 --> 01:00:41.989
Oh, it was an amazing pass.

01:00:42.209 --> 01:00:50.383
And then this swing from Wallace just placing it precisely right down the line for that point in a much needed side out for Brazil.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:13.388
Lucas as that sent back and then it's taken off the block and away in Japan, resolutely trying to dig in here.

01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:18.855
All smiles from Sekita as Onodara takes care of business here.

01:01:29.848 --> 01:01:30.529
Ishikawa.

01:01:48.903 --> 01:01:50.004
Wallace de Souza.

01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:56.293
Nice, the angle served there.

01:01:57.154 --> 01:01:59.457
Ryan Takahashi runs into the block.

01:01:59.477 --> 01:02:00.519
He'll have another go here.

01:02:00.559 --> 01:02:02.021
The containing block is there.

01:02:02.061 --> 01:02:04.404
He gets the better of it, but Wallace is there to keep it alive.

01:02:04.424 --> 01:02:06.767
Luka Relly sets it up and lay it off.

01:02:06.787 --> 01:02:09.350
Takes it off and Ishida's attempted dig.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:12.835
Ishida in retrospect, maybe should have left that alone, but...

01:02:13.405 --> 01:02:15.908
It's his touch, sends it out, and they back come Brazil.

01:02:16.569 --> 01:02:22.596
Wallace doing a great job to keep this ball alive in the set from Luccarelli to his teammate.

01:02:25.439 --> 01:02:26.901
They all get that point.

01:02:26.921 --> 01:02:28.703
Pretty sure that was dropping in there anyway.

01:02:28.843 --> 01:02:30.145
He had to try and make a play at it.

01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:35.211
Wallace.

01:02:35.832 --> 01:02:39.460
down the line to Takahashi Nishida is wiped out.

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:40.803
Absolutely wiped out.

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:41.725
Was that Flavio?

01:02:41.785 --> 01:02:42.948
Was it Luccarelli?

01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:43.910
Brazil don't care.

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:45.633
They'll take another stuff block.

01:02:47.518 --> 01:02:48.881
Leal with the right hand.

01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:52.288
Keeping it over just long enough to get that block point.

01:02:58.867 --> 01:03:01.791
It's going to take blocks now for Brazil.

01:03:04.054 --> 01:03:05.156
I think he's put too much on that.

01:03:05.656 --> 01:03:08.240
Yeah, around Takahashi.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:09.181
Sends that too deep.

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:26.325
Well, they've made the strong start, but they've been overhauled by Brazil already here in Japan.

01:03:31.537 --> 01:03:34.561
We have to find solution of it, huh?

01:03:34.581 --> 01:03:34.942
Okay?

01:03:36.063 --> 01:03:39.028
Sometime or so, using push or, huh?

01:03:39.528 --> 01:03:42.633
You can use many things, working with, huh?

01:03:42.653 --> 01:03:43.775
There you go.

01:03:43.795 --> 01:03:46.078
But we don't forget fight, also.

01:03:46.158 --> 01:03:58.776
We don't play so much, so we can go, we can go, but we don't fight.

01:04:13.775 --> 01:04:14.596
Off the timeout.

01:04:15.056 --> 01:04:17.038
Here comes Wallace, Brazil 6-5.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.101
Serving Yamamoto.

01:04:20.902 --> 01:04:23.124
Sent back side, Nishida takes it off the block.

01:04:24.906 --> 01:04:27.569
Side out.

01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:30.672
Lael knows he's very close to getting a block on Nishida.

01:04:31.213 --> 01:04:35.257
But you can see him reach back in and Nishida just targets the forearm and goes out of bounds.

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.281
As you say, he knows.

01:04:39.341 --> 01:04:41.263
That's a couple of inches.

01:04:41.923 --> 01:04:43.545
And he's got himself another block point.

01:04:44.993 --> 01:04:47.016
Fine margins, always is in this game.

01:04:48.898 --> 01:04:54.065
That's a pretty soft serve coming in from Onadira, who's got underneath that somehow, that is some rescue.

01:04:56.027 --> 01:04:59.872
And then nothing doing there for Takahashi, who's denied at the baseline, and then a block.

01:05:00.433 --> 01:05:07.542
Oh, it's gone out, it's spun away from Yamachi, thought he'd got himself a block point there, and it just took that wicked spin off court.

01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:13.576
Leal scoring his 13th point of the match and he is not showing any signs of slowing down.

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:18.923
Taking swing after swing, scoring points for his side.

01:05:27.152 --> 01:05:32.078
Leal, some of a zinger, nicely collected, Brian Takahashi.

01:05:32.817 --> 01:05:35.844
No winner for him, but always kind of swing at that.

01:05:35.924 --> 01:05:36.565
Would you believe it?

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.470
You know, Andy Leal from a mile back.

01:05:39.432 --> 01:05:41.296
And now Brazil will look to transition.

01:05:41.657 --> 01:05:42.819
Set it up on the inside.

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.104
Brilliant from Ishikawa back.

01:05:45.124 --> 01:05:46.327
He can't keep it in play.

01:05:46.588 --> 01:05:47.670
And they're just being...

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:49.950
Overworked here, Japan.

01:05:50.091 --> 01:05:54.799
I mean, so strong defensively, but Brazil just keeps sending the heavy hitters out there, Adam.

01:05:54.819 --> 01:05:59.266
Well, Leal wanted that one and Fernando knows who the hot hitter is.

01:06:00.068 --> 01:06:01.110
He's setting Leal.

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:13.050
No matter where he is on the court, he's taking a swing at it.

01:06:23.408 --> 01:06:29.619
That's a tough one for Sekita to deal with, yeah.

01:06:29.639 --> 01:06:30.461
We'll do this one again.

01:06:36.031 --> 01:06:40.258
That's good to see the referee taking responsibility of that.

01:06:40.619 --> 01:06:43.003
I'm sorry guys, can we do this one again please?

01:06:43.287 --> 01:06:48.985
bit quick on the whistle, wanted to call the double, but realized that Lukarelli was playing it back to his own side.

01:06:49.908 --> 01:06:51.473
Players don't mind that.

01:06:52.135 --> 01:06:53.098
Everybody makes a mistake.

01:06:54.081 --> 01:06:57.111
He put his hands up, said, yeah, that's on me, and everyone's just going to get on with it.

01:07:15.333 --> 01:07:18.182
Leal at 86 into the net.

01:07:23.618 --> 01:07:26.727
Just trying to stick around here, Japan, and service errors will help.

01:07:38.823 --> 01:07:41.267
Tales with a perfect service reception.

01:07:41.387 --> 01:07:42.850
No winner there though for Flavio.

01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:45.154
This time they've contained that in comes Ishikawa.

01:07:45.174 --> 01:07:46.115
Does he catch the line?

01:07:46.135 --> 01:07:48.279
And the answer to that is no, he does not.

01:07:50.282 --> 01:07:52.666
Well, Ishikawa missed that opportunity.

01:07:52.706 --> 01:07:58.296
Flavio reaches to the right side and Ishikawa misses to the wrist away.

01:07:59.838 --> 01:08:00.600
You're playing Brazil.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.603
Those are the kind of shots you've got to have.

01:08:04.405 --> 01:08:10.813
Flavio serving Yamamoto, an easy take for him and an easy put away for Yamachi, uncontested.

01:08:22.929 --> 01:08:27.915
Japan not utilizing their middles a lot in this match so it's good to see them get a point here and there.

01:08:32.688 --> 01:08:36.171
Again, really nice pick up there from Lukarelli, who will get third touch on this.

01:08:36.311 --> 01:08:38.793
Ooh, did that take anything on the way through?

01:08:38.833 --> 01:08:41.996
They're saying no, and immediately Lukas is saying, you challenged that.

01:08:42.276 --> 01:08:43.758
Lukas had big eyes on that.

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:48.882
Yeah, as soon as the challenge came in, Japan admitted to the touch.

01:08:52.445 --> 01:08:58.971
We'll see the replay here, but right there off the pinky.

01:08:58.991 --> 01:09:01.193
Yeah, Yamachi saying, yeah, that's on me.

01:09:03.755 --> 01:09:06.739
Fernando.

01:09:06.759 --> 01:09:10.565
10-8 Brazil.

01:09:11.166 --> 01:09:13.089
He's mixing his serves up.

01:09:13.109 --> 01:09:14.811
Sakita sends it over to Ishikawa.

01:09:14.852 --> 01:09:16.754
That's picked up by Fernando down the line.

01:09:16.794 --> 01:09:19.078
This will be Luccarelli looking at this one.

01:09:19.138 --> 01:09:20.620
And I think he's overheated that one.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.401
That goes wide.

01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:29.914
Luccarelli just missing the sideline there as well.

01:09:33.387 --> 01:09:38.371
There's just enough misses and service errors from Brazil to keep Japan within touching distance here.

01:09:41.534 --> 01:09:45.718
But then Yamachi has got to make sure his serves go in, especially when it's as soft as that.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.502
And he doesn't need anyone to tell him that.

01:09:57.909 --> 01:09:59.410
Lukarelli then, 11-9.

01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:00.752
Got to be side out Japan.

01:10:01.012 --> 01:10:02.213
Just got to dig in here.

01:10:03.138 --> 01:10:04.640
Stay close, Sekita under.

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:08.184
Intense pressure feeds Nishida and that won't drop their weight.

01:10:09.425 --> 01:10:10.666
Well, it was all service reception.

01:10:10.726 --> 01:10:12.128
The pass was not perfect.

01:10:12.148 --> 01:10:18.495
Sekita did well just to give Nishida any kind of play at all, but the defenders were just lining up.

01:10:18.515 --> 01:10:22.980
Yeah, Leal finally getting that one off of Nishida that he missed earlier.

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:28.386
And Sekita a little frustrated with this setting location there after that play was over.

01:10:30.205 --> 01:10:33.309
Luccarelli at 12-9 Brazil.

01:10:38.236 --> 01:10:40.459
Takahashi picking that one up.

01:10:40.479 --> 01:10:41.721
Now, has Nishida got that?

01:10:41.861 --> 01:10:42.762
No, he hasn't.

01:10:42.782 --> 01:10:43.483
He hasn't.

01:10:44.765 --> 01:10:49.331
I think this match has just gone away from Japan, just in these last two points.

01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:50.432
Just a little off the net.

01:10:50.492 --> 01:10:53.617
Nishida trying to make something of it, but just misses the inline.

01:10:55.359 --> 01:10:56.240
Nishida out.

01:10:56.941 --> 01:10:59.925
Kento Miara in for Japan.

01:11:06.571 --> 01:11:10.635
Lukarelli serving at 13-9, desperately needed side out here for Japan.

01:11:10.655 --> 01:11:11.756
Two of them going for that one.

01:11:13.038 --> 01:11:20.946
Yamamoto setting from way, way, way back and Fernando sets up the pipe attack and that is just drilled by Lukarelli.

01:11:20.966 --> 01:11:24.690
And again, Japan in disarray on their service reception and they've paid for it.

01:11:26.392 --> 01:11:30.216
Lukarelli just hammers that ball into that open seam.

01:11:44.219 --> 01:11:45.881
Lukareli serving Yamamoto.

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:47.764
Sekita has to move around a little bit.

01:11:47.824 --> 01:11:56.995
Miara has to take a very, very clever swing at that because the blockers were lining up to send that back and he's been very creative with his swing.

01:11:57.015 --> 01:12:01.040
Yeah, nice off-speed shot there from the opposite that just came in.

01:12:05.346 --> 01:12:07.489
Brunos living every point there, isn't he, on the bench?

01:12:10.372 --> 01:12:14.057
So Miara opening his account off the bench.

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:19.737
That's all he's going to have for his tally after he comes up with a service error.

01:12:19.757 --> 01:12:21.659
Brazil with such a comfortable lead here.

01:12:37.661 --> 01:12:38.022
Clever.

01:12:39.744 --> 01:12:40.385
Nishikawa.

01:12:41.246 --> 01:12:42.508
Yeah, very clever indeed, Nick.

01:12:42.528 --> 01:12:44.230
Nishikawa changing up the pace.

01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:49.899
Placing it precisely past the block of Wallace.

01:12:57.855 --> 01:13:01.943
Well, how they would like a couple of aces here from Yuki Ishikawa.

01:13:04.207 --> 01:13:05.830
For now, there's got some work to do there.

01:13:06.839 --> 01:13:09.704
not the greatest of service receptions, and can they get themselves out of it?

01:13:09.724 --> 01:13:14.893
They can because he lay out, you know, and lay out with great touch and depth on that swing.

01:13:15.054 --> 01:13:16.276
Just lay out having a match.

01:13:16.296 --> 01:13:17.738
That's his 16th point.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:22.888
And finally showing that he can change the pace up a little bit and still be effective.

01:13:26.594 --> 01:13:27.075
Wallace.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.163
Talis has got that off the floor somehow.

01:13:35.223 --> 01:13:36.145
Goodness only knows how.

01:13:36.165 --> 01:13:40.031
Oh, that is a perfect push.

01:13:40.051 --> 01:13:40.772
Luke Corelli.

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:43.957
Goodness me.

01:13:45.719 --> 01:13:48.664
It's your fans' blockers deciding not to let's lay all their hands out.

01:13:48.684 --> 01:13:49.425
Luke Corelli, excuse me.

01:13:52.991 --> 01:13:54.974
Everything going the way of Brazil now?

01:13:55.454 --> 01:13:55.915
That's OK.

01:14:04.484 --> 01:14:07.650
You can see from the body language, he knows this.

01:14:08.692 --> 01:14:10.095
There's no way back from this.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:14.904
Six point deficit here in set number three.

01:14:15.465 --> 01:14:17.970
Brazil really playing some strong volleyball.

01:14:19.182 --> 01:14:23.246
Until Yoandil Leal, who had that last point, not look great as I incorrectly picked up.

01:14:23.286 --> 01:14:25.928
You said it earlier, he's just having one of those games.

01:14:25.989 --> 01:14:29.492
I mean, he's seeing everything big and slow and everything he's attempting.

01:14:29.912 --> 01:14:31.714
It just happens like that somehow for you as a player.

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:37.600
Everything drops into place and it really has been working for Yoandil Leal today and the last 10 points.

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.542
I mean, it's been a wipeout.

01:14:40.923 --> 01:14:47.009
Yeah, Brazil, behind the efforts of Leal, really up their level, just firing on all cylinders.

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:48.430
Everybody has contributed.

01:14:49.793 --> 01:14:54.399
with stood the pressure from the inline for Japan and come right back with their own.

01:15:02.249 --> 01:15:03.370
By Patak.

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:04.251
Drilled that, Thales.

01:15:05.853 --> 01:15:12.181
By Ishikawa, who will actually come through the net, just to make sure that the Brazil libero is okay.

01:15:12.562 --> 01:15:12.962
He is.

01:15:16.306 --> 01:15:17.708
What are the dangers of

01:15:19.274 --> 01:15:20.597
Standing that close.

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.685
Tal is getting that one right off of the chin.

01:15:26.493 --> 01:15:28.478
He's going to take a second just to gather himself.

01:15:30.162 --> 01:15:31.185
But smiles all around.

01:15:31.525 --> 01:15:32.929
Yeah, he's OK. Part of the game.

01:15:49.902 --> 01:15:51.424
Too big a hit from Wallace.

01:15:52.686 --> 01:15:57.494
It's the consistency of the hitting from Wallace and from Luca Raleigh, and of course we talked about Yoendi Layal.

01:15:57.514 --> 01:16:01.881
I mean, not been too many unforced errors from that gang of three this afternoon.

01:16:04.605 --> 01:16:05.667
Ayres have been very limited.

01:16:05.967 --> 01:16:07.810
Layal, Wallace, Luca Raleigh.

01:16:24.682 --> 01:16:26.344
Takahashi tries to be clever.

01:16:27.205 --> 01:16:28.067
It's the right idea.

01:16:28.387 --> 01:16:34.475
Oh, Luccarelli improvising something there and then it's all gone wrong for Ishikawa.

01:16:35.016 --> 01:16:37.219
Luccarelli trying to run a quick attack there.

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:44.108
He's seen Lucas do it for so long you wanted to get in on that action when Flavio wasn't there with the misconnection.

01:16:44.982 --> 01:16:47.586
You know, it's good to see Japan smiling and seeing the funny side.

01:16:47.606 --> 01:16:52.413
This actually sets up a huge third match for them in the pool phase against Cuba.

01:16:53.034 --> 01:16:55.958
I mean, they've got to get something out of that, or they could face elimination.

01:16:57.681 --> 01:17:11.682
Yeah, a nice little push there from Ran Takahashi.

01:17:22.715 --> 01:17:25.299
That's crashing it down there wasn't it Flavio?

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:30.226
You know maybe falling two sets behind a Cuban is exactly what this Brazil squad needed.

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:39.600
You know they came in after and by their stands that indifferent volleyball nation's league they fall two down and everyone starts looking at them and I think they looked at themselves and said no no no we're better than this.

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:43.365
But since then they've just been inspired.

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:47.351
Character moment for sure and perhaps it's carried over into this match.

01:17:47.391 --> 01:17:50.055
I mean this is going to be a statement victory for them that

01:17:50.491 --> 01:17:52.835
Everybody else in the world championships is going to take note of.

01:17:54.197 --> 01:17:54.658
Darlan.

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:57.362
We know what he can do from the service line.

01:17:57.503 --> 01:17:58.424
It's another beauty.

01:17:58.825 --> 01:18:10.244
Ran Takahashi picks it up, but when you're setting from there, you're asking for trouble, and sure enough, there is very little chance for Takahashi there as Miara was setting all the way back to our commentary position there.

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:12.027
It's impossible.

01:18:12.614 --> 01:18:14.518
Very compromised situation for Japan.

01:18:15.239 --> 01:18:17.082
Setting the ball from that far off the court.

01:18:17.343 --> 01:18:18.886
This is some weapon to bring off the bench.

01:18:19.527 --> 01:18:20.188
This really is.

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:22.312
I'll tell you, Darlan.

01:18:22.833 --> 01:18:24.316
Darlan's bringing it when he serves.

01:18:27.241 --> 01:18:28.243
There goes another one in it.

01:18:28.263 --> 01:18:29.706
This is devastating.

01:18:29.726 --> 01:18:31.089
Absolutely devastating.

01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:32.952
Wow, what a serve.

01:18:38.872 --> 01:18:40.594
Oh, that had everything.

01:18:41.134 --> 01:18:46.440
Fly, spin, power, direction.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:51.766
Tomio Miro Yamamoto could not deal with it at all, and there wouldn't have been many players in the world who could.

01:18:53.487 --> 01:18:55.349
Darlan looking for another big one.

01:18:55.369 --> 01:18:56.410
That's way too big.

01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:02.817
But hey, that's job done.

01:19:03.518 --> 01:19:05.120
That's another really good cameo.

01:19:06.161 --> 01:19:08.423
Yeah, he gets the other boys on the bench.

01:19:09.685 --> 01:19:15.491
And Brazil, three points from wrapping this thing up.

01:19:15.511 --> 01:19:16.171
Takahashi.

01:19:17.633 --> 01:19:19.234
Picked up by Leal.

01:19:19.975 --> 01:19:21.396
Lukarelli.

01:19:21.416 --> 01:19:22.117
No, that's nice.

01:19:22.437 --> 01:19:24.660
From Ran Takahashi, Ishikawa.

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:26.842
No, that's picked up by Yoandil Leal.

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:30.605
And then they block him, but the block goes out.

01:19:30.665 --> 01:19:32.747
So Wallace will claim himself another winner.

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:38.613
Miara was certainly there, one of a gang of three from Japan, and they could not keep it in play.

01:19:38.713 --> 01:19:39.574
And Brazil,

01:19:40.853 --> 01:19:42.515
Moved to within two points.

01:19:52.606 --> 01:19:53.748
Fernando serving at 23-14.

01:19:54.769 --> 01:19:56.150
What a professional job.

01:19:56.771 --> 01:20:00.035
Renan Balzotto's squad have performed this afternoon.

01:20:02.878 --> 01:20:06.422
It was a match you thought potentially could have been fraught with danger for Brazil.

01:20:07.448 --> 01:20:12.274
and they've turned it into a comfortable straight sets victory.

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:19.863
You can't even say Japan have played particularly badly, but Brazil have really brought it today.

01:20:22.446 --> 01:20:24.809
And so Yamachi with a little flash of defiance.

01:20:27.532 --> 01:20:33.760
Well, that's all it is.

01:20:42.312 --> 01:20:43.654
Gavacci with serve.

01:20:44.215 --> 01:20:45.177
Thales picks that up.

01:20:46.379 --> 01:20:48.282
And that's another one for Wallace.

01:20:49.264 --> 01:20:57.198
And that brings up an awful lot of match points.

01:21:01.726 --> 01:21:06.514
The longer it's gone on, there is a chasm has opened up between these two teams.

01:21:07.726 --> 01:21:13.171
The Japan are staring down the barrel of a pretty comprehensive straight sets defeat here.

01:21:15.814 --> 01:21:18.457
Lukarelli.

01:21:18.477 --> 01:21:22.421
Sekita manages to set up Miara, and he's found himself a winner there.

01:21:24.062 --> 01:21:27.986
Oh, Kento Miara.

01:21:28.006 --> 01:21:30.148
Forcing Lukarelli to make a decision here.

01:21:30.208 --> 01:21:30.869
Does he leave it?

01:21:30.889 --> 01:21:31.710
Does he go for it?

01:21:33.492 --> 01:21:34.813
And he decided to go for it.

01:21:36.008 --> 01:21:41.207
That delays the moment.

01:21:41.227 --> 01:21:47.571
Miara will be lining up to serve once we've got the moisture cleaned off the floor.

01:22:08.054 --> 01:22:10.487
Yara serves Thales, that could be an overpass.

01:22:10.507 --> 01:22:20.140
Fernando has somehow rescued it one-handed and Lucas puts it away and that point right there sums up Brazil's quality.

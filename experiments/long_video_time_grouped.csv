3946,24842,"What a start, what a start.I mean you can't do it any better than that.That's one way to start a match up with a clean ace between Luca Raleigh and Talis there.There's the old story.If you can split two of them, they either both go for it, or at night of them go for it.They both leave it.That's what he got there.And they both had to go for that one.",0.34826666666666667
24862,45664,"It's another beautiful serve.That'll get picked up by Yamamoto.He'll do a lot of that.And then Nishida pops up far side.That's contained.Fernando will set up the Piper tag.And that's a bit of a surprise.Oh, that pushed too long.Two attacks.No kills yet for Brazil.",0.3467
47534,68005,"down 0-2 here very early on, but not perhaps the greatest start that the Brazilians were looking for.Yeah, Luca really pushing it.Nishida with another ace.And again, he's got both of them going for it.I mean, his lasers are fine-tuned here.He's dropping it between two players every time.Here's another one.",0.34118333333333334
68305,90022,"Nishida is just so strong, this time attacking the seam of Leal and Thales.His second ace of the match and just three serves.Now, Philly Blaine is saying, you carry on like that.Let's have another 22 like that.Well, is he going to fight with another one?No, he's not.",0.36195
90042,105503,"That's a job done by Eugene Nishida.Devastating burst of serving to open up this match.Side out, we'll see Lucas Suck come back there.He won this competition back in 2010.Still going.",0.2576833333333333
110056,127305,"It's easier to say what Lucas Sackkamp hasn't had a major medal in.I mean, he's got the full set.His resume is extremely long and very decorated.And club and international level opens up with a long serve.Japan with the early jump here.",0.2874833333333333
131015,156803,"Not Suka serving Luccarelli, who just about deals with that.That's Wallace with no real play on there.A little whiff there, I think, in the middle from Onadira, and they pay for that.Yohendi Leal says that's enough of that.That's an attack matchup that's advantage to Brazil.Leal attacking against Sekita, the smaller setter, but that time Leal goes hard cross court for the winner.",0.4298
158335,177728,"So Wallace, another one of these veterans with serve.It's a nice take.Look out.Eugene Nishida absolutely rips it down there.I mean, that's Thales who gets everything back in the backcourt for Brazil, but that was just too hot even for him to handle.Nishida off to a brilliant start here.",0.32321666666666665
178450,204647,"That's his third point of the match.The net serve from Aladira, side out.Leal.",0.43661666666666665
207731,233400,"Oh, nice.Nice.Hey, they need a kick start.Maybe Joanne Leal can provide it.Well, Brazil gets an ace back this time from Leal, challenging that seam.Yamamoto, we should have taken that one.So Leal looking to level it up here for Brazil.And he does with another ace and a completely different serve that's swirled away from Ran Takahashi.",0.4278166666666667
233420,257533,"Well, this is outstanding serving from Yande Leal.And this is one of the hardest balls to pass.Straight at you, actually going away from Ran to his line.Line to line serve from Leal for another ace.It's been a while since we've had a hat trick of aces.And we're going to have to wait again.It's a much better take from Ran Takahashi who comes up with third touch as well.",0.4018833333333333
257573,276615,"And it's a perfect one right at the feet of the back row defender.Great pass leads to great in-system offense and Ran Takahashi attacking against Fernando.That's advantage Japan all match long.Masahiro Sakita, the setter.Oh, he's found a nice.",0.3173666666666667
278924,300053,"I mean, Sakita's not known for his devastating serving, but sometimes it's about placement.It doesn't have the power that Nishida has, but the placement is equally as effective through the seam and deep into the court.The ace is coming thick and fast in this match.Fernando goes for the quick inside second.That's Flavio flying high there.",0.35215
300073,329383,"Flavio, which is so athletic.Works hard to get around, Fernando.Running that drift pattern.floats away from the center and opens up that wrist away angle for the point.Zekita with the forward inside set, that doesn't work.So we'll have another go here with Yamauchi and they contain that Brazil and now they look to transition with Luccarelli ripping it off the block and Brazil starting to go through the gears here now after that slow start.",0.4885
330663,350829,"Now the Brazilian squad has to get momentum behind them, right?Nishita started this match out with some quality serving, but Luca Raleigh getting a chance to get activated in the front row.Scores on that first attack.Flavio stays on serve.No, he doesn't.Side out.Sends that on a little bit too deep.Both teams have been very, very aggressive with their serves, which you like to see.",0.3361
352491,373841,"But it means you will get some deep long serves.You'll get some net serves.Here is Iran, Takahashi.21 in a few days time.full of youthful energy.Again, it's a really nice pick up on Luca Rally.Full of energy at 30 years old as well.Part of the Olympic gold medal winning score for Brazil.",0.35583333333333333
373861,400655,"That'll be a fun matchup.Luca Rally hitting against Nishita and vice versa, obviously.Luca Rally winning that first challenge.Fernando plays his club volleyball in Italy for Monza with serve.That's picked up off the floor and that'll go out to Nishida who tries a little bit of finesse and the block was there to contain it and goes for a big power swing instead this time.",0.44656666666666667
400675,417859,"And again, Talis can't deal with it.That's two that Nishida has zipped past the Brazil libero.Now Luca's got stuck at the net.It's the only blocker.Nishida sees the alley and flushes that ball off the libero.Here a Yamauchi.",0.28640000000000004
423965,439923,"It's picked up by Thales.And the lovely angle taken there on the crosscourt from Luca Relli.Now, Luca Relli had ankle all day to attack as that Suka drifted past the antenna on this move.Luca Relli knows exactly what to do with that set.",0.2659666666666667
450635,475082,"Oh, my goodness, what a pick up that was.So that's going to be collected by Luccarelli backcourt and hello Well, you won't see that too often Lucas are come straight into the net This opportunity there is Lucas got a great deflection On his block however the connection between him and Fernando Not firing there",0.40745
477728,500196,"Nishida, and it's another sizzler it really is.That's sent backwards.Luccarelli setting from about five metres behind the back line.but they do keep it in play.Now Sekita has options and he'll send it to Otsuka.That doesn't come up with a winner either.This could be trouble.Yohan Delayal almost taking the head of Rantakashi off there, but he's kept it in play.",0.37446666666666667
500216,520591,"And then they come up with the winner as well.That's typical Japan defense.Just send everything back.Yeah, great defense in the backcourt from Japan after a strong serve again from the inline.Both teams working really hard.Here's another dig.Just back over the net.Keep the rally going.",0.33958333333333335
521672,542754,"Lukareli has to step in and set.And it's a block that catches Wallace on the way out.That's a big bonus for Japan.Nishida.No.Brazil, very happy to see that one go long.",0.35136666666666666
542774,571557,"Yeah, they are.Deep Saira leave, saying that she'd have missed that serve.Lucas at 10-11.Sekid has to scramble around and Otsuka has done really well because the three-man block had all data get set there and bad things could have happened but Tatsunori Otsuka rubbed it off the block an hour.",0.4797166666666667
572617,594338,"Japan escaping this one a great serve from Lucas to the corner and then a really well-formed three-man block, but Japan gets the side out Another really good serve Talies has to hoist that one up there and Luke Carelli Can't get a winner, but Yamamoto setting from behind his baseline and somehow that's been shoveled over goodness only knows how",0.36201666666666665
595415,619336,"Yoendilay, I can't find a winner, Sekita.As they go back in the system and did that catch the line?No, it did not.Otsuka goes too long.That's a missed opportunity, Japan.Yeah, it certainly is.Otsuka just misses the contact.Trying for the corner, but it was just long.",0.39868333333333333
619356,647993,Wallace.He's put a little bit too much under that one as well.,0.47728333333333334
648033,668508,"That really caught a thermal on the way over the net, didn't it?A bit of a tail in on that one.Pushed it way out of bounds.Uandy Leal, the Cuban born outside hitter, zings that one too deep and we're getting a rash of service errors now.",0.34125
669991,692198,"Part of the reason for that is both these sides know you can't play safe at this level.You've got to do something.The borrow was set early on with two aces.And a response from Brazil.Now the service pressure continues.Sakita's serve is picked up by Leal, Fernando has to scramble around and that allowed the block to get set.And you know what, that might have been Ran Takahashi getting the final touch on that one.",0.3701166666666667
692659,714691,"That's a real bonus for Japan if Ran is getting block points.That is him as well.This ball has got to get covered by either Flavio or Lael.They're both standing there, watching it hit the floor.Hey, hey, let's get together here.Hey, let's get together here.The first thing is to hit two of them.",0.3672

741419,763782,"Japan have opened up a nice healthy lead again.There's such an air of confidence about this Japan squad.We saw it in the volleyball nations league early this year and they went to the quarter-final stage, which was their best result.You know, they hosted their own Olympics, got to the quarterfinals there.They're suddenly banging on the door of being a top, top contender now.",0.37271666666666664
766807,797074,"Ooh, did Flavio get anything on that?No, he did not get a touch on the way through.Well, so far the middle attackers for Brazil not finding the court.Flavio trying for the hard angle, but missing wide.Sekita's serve is not particularly well handled, but the down the line from Wallace is an absolutely drill that Yamamoto, who just has to send it spinning off at a crazy angle.",0.50445
797214,821446,"The set from Fernando and Wallace able to turn that one hard down the line.So that'll set up Flavio, Brazil with points to make up here.Sekita will pick that up nicely.Nishida is also picked up by Wallace in the backcourt there and now Wallace can try and scuff that one over and how many touches are they going to have?",0.40386666666666665
821466,842090,Bit unlucky for Japan that time it was a good block move they got some hands on that attack as well just not able to play it cleanly out of the netFlavio serving Otsuka.Nice from Miyamachi.,0.34373333333333334
842190,860878,"Good execution.Well, that all started with the pass.Japan hasn't been able to run their middles very much, but they got a perfect pass and system that time.They score the point through the middle.Brian Takahashi.Well, graduated from college, went straight into the Italian League, playing for Padua.",0.31146666666666667
862732,882717,"Boom.Joanne Leal sends that back with interest.He's in Italy as well.We'll be with Pierre Chinz the next season.Just a perfectly timed, big attack.You see both blockers jumping on Lucas.Leal can take care of that one all day long.So Brazil staying close here.Fernando can get him a bit closer.",0.33308333333333334
883658,898560,"He's getting a nice pass, but an even better block from Lucas.Lucas was just one of the best middle blockers in the world.So experienced.What a reaction.Just gets his hands up and over the net and the monster block.",0.24836666666666665
904666,924488,"So Fernando looking to level this one up.Good response, this from Brazil.That's got to be good and is.I tell you what, Suga's found the corner there beautifully.Just clipping that baseline.Yeah, Suga's had a good start to this match.It's his third point here in this opening set.Yeah, he's the guy that's in the starting line-up with Ishikawa on the bench, the captain.",0.33036666666666664
925349,941288,"We saw Ishikawa come off the bench against Kata, and I know you were talking to Coach Philippe Blaine earlier in the week, and he alluded to just the management of some niggling injuries for Ishikawa, so they're not gonna work him too hard this early in the tournament.It is all about managing your players through a tournament like this.",0.26565
945754,967105,"So whether we see Ishikawa or not remains to be seen.What he's not ready to be, obviously, is a workhorse at the moment.And that means others can step up like Otsuka.Yamachi with serve.That's gone.Now, Fernando and Lucas communicating to each other after that play.",0.35585
967446,987577,"Lucas asking for a little bit of a higher set, perhaps, but this time he's able to score the point.Listen, if Lucas is asking for something, Lucas is going to get it.drilled by Lukarelli, kept alive.Nishida with a clever push, Talies with the pancake to keep it alive as well.",0.3355166666666667
987597,1006375,"And then the cross call from you, and now is perfect.The Brazil offensive, Jung and Orton is starting to go through the gears here.But what a save to keep that ball alive by the back row player for Brazil.Tied at 18-all and Japan decides to use a timeout.",0.31296666666666667

1094112,1113589,Could have gotten the first one.But Wallace comes through with a huge block this time on Otsuka.scoring the point and finishing off that rally.Natsuka will sit down as Ishikawa will come in.That's probably not a surprise.,0.32461666666666666

1190059,1208112,"Lucas, Brazil going through the gears and put themselves in a good position here.That was Ishikawa running into the containing block, but that's better.Fernando would love to have that one back.It got past the block, and I don't think Fernando was expecting that.Oh, Fernando kind of charges in.",0.30088333333333334
1211059,1232469,"Catches him up high.But a missed defensive opportunity that time.Japan still looking for the point on serve to get him back level.Ishikawa.serves Leal, who handles that one perfectly.We looked at what an angle.What an angle he took there.I mean, Takahashi was there to cover it, but just couldn't get a play on that at all.",0.35683333333333334
1232529,1253185,"It was too good.This angle, challenging the middle, blasting it past the left hand.An extreme angle from Leal on the left side here.Yeah, Ranzakashi's got that cover.He read it all the way.You just couldn't do anything with it.Wallace, another powerful serve.That'll go inside.Wallace picks that up on the dig.Fernanda goes back side.",0.34426666666666667

1274372,1297978,"Yeah, a great swing on the right side.Some chaos throughout that play, but Leal getting stuck on the right side because they switched their blockers.Fernando went to the left, Leal to the right.That's why he's attacking on the right side on the counter attack.This might just be a catch of breath time out.So, both sides, they make pressure outside the block.",0.39343333333333336

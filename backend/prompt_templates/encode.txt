### 🎯 3️⃣ Your Task:
From the given commentary segment(s), identify only **real volleyball actions** that occur on the court.  
Each detected event must include:

- `"Team"` → `"Japan"` or `"Brazil"`  
- `"Player"` → Corrected player name  
- `"Action"` → Short, precise description of the player’s main action (e.g., `"spikes"`, `"sets to Nishida"`, `"blocks Lucarelli"`, `"digs Nishida’s attack"`)  
- `"Description"` → Optional adjectives or expressive phrases describing *how* the action was performed (e.g., `"massive spike"`, `"beautiful set"`, `"crucial block"`, `"powerful serve"`). If no descriptive language is found, leave this field empty (`""`).

Do **not** include filler commentary, background analysis, or general remarks like “What a start!” unless they directly modify an action.

### 🧾 4️⃣ Output Format:

[
  {
    "Team": "Japan",
    "Player": "Sekita",
    "Action": "sets the ball to Nishida (back row)",
    "Description": "perfect setup"
  },

    "Action": "blocks Nishida’s spike",
    "Description": "crucial block at the net"
  },
  {
    "Team": "Japan",
    "Player": "Yamaguchi",
    "Action": "digs Lucarelli’s attack",
    "Description": "diving save"
  }
]

### ⚠️ 6️⃣ Extraction Rules:
- Include only gameplay actions.
- Fix all player name errors.
- Ignore commentators discussing *past plays* unless context clearly indicates ongoing action.
- Split multi-action sentences into multiple JSON entries (e.g., “Nishida spikes, blocked by Wallace” → two events).
- Keep the `"Description"` expressive but factual — only adjectives from commentary or clear implications (e.g., “powerful”, “quick”, “crucial”, “high”, “clean”).
- Maintain chronological order.
- Ensure the output is valid JSON with no trailing commas.

[00:05] [Unknown]: Day in white, serving Japan in red, receiving is the final match of the men's volleyball nation's league for week three here at the Port of Chiba Arena in Japan.
[00:15] [Unknown]: And it is a side-act start.
[00:24] [Unknown]: Garcia, Doug, Miore, Doug.
[00:30] [Unknown]: Down ball.
[00:32] [Unknown]: Good chance in there, Japan.
[00:33] [Unknown]: Four players all moving.
[00:35] [Unknown]: It's a power, doesn't find his range, but he has found the block on the way through.
[00:39] [Unknown]: No, he hasn't.
[00:41] [Unknown]: Which they do right now.
[00:42] [Unknown]: Miura steps in.
[00:46] [Unknown]: Good up for Kawa, his trademark dig.
[00:48] [Unknown]: Let's splay that behind him.
[00:52] [Unknown]: Like he's doing a dig and a push-up.
[00:54] [Unknown]: Nice up from Briggs.
[00:59] [Unknown]: Lance.
[01:01] [Unknown]: straight through the defense.
[01:09] [Unknown]: Raishan will do it.
[01:10] [Unknown]: It's going to be about going high and swinging hard.
[01:14] [Unknown]: They have to use all of the tools at their disposal.
[01:19] [Unknown]: Ma once again.
[01:22] [Unknown]: Trying to push his shikara deep.
[01:24] [Unknown]: That is a great swing.
[01:25] [Unknown]: Sato's banged it.
[01:28] [Unknown]: All right, to take away position one.
[01:30] [Unknown]: Sanzo stays on his approach.
[01:40] [Unknown]: Nairo.
[01:49] [Unknown]: Really good play.
[01:53] [Unknown]: That's got some horrible spin on it USA trying to make something happen they have done But yeah, there's a way to use enough of the system to find some gray areas see what you want Awesome
[02:19] [Unknown]: Oh, I have to use both my hands so there's at least nine calculations.
[02:26] [Unknown]: Oh, look how unlucky.
[02:29] [Unknown]: No one can react as quickly as he can.
[02:35] [Unknown]: Next, the USA have to play.
[02:38] [Unknown]: Oh, Robinson came to play.
[02:40] [Unknown]: Wow, he is well over the top.
[02:46] [Unknown]: And the vice-vibes captain for Japan turns to the bench on the Tomita.
[02:57] [Unknown]: Goal, Robinson!
[03:01] [Unknown]: Bamiura, 7-0 all day.
[03:02] [Unknown]: Japan take the opening set, 25-21.
[03:11] [Unknown]: Nice ball in there, from Robinson.
[03:14] [Unknown]: From Uet rather, Robinson was flying in.
[03:18] [Unknown]: Great read from Japan.
[03:21] [Unknown]: An opportunity there.
[03:29] [Unknown]: And yet... Oh, dear.
[03:38] [Unknown]: He's made that Garcia.
[03:39] [Unknown]: That is incredible!
[03:41] [Unknown]: What a shot!
[03:42] [Unknown]: Full set, so it needs to get in the window first and then to drill this one on the line.
[03:47] [Unknown]: Oh, he's watched the ball.
[03:49] [Unknown]: Never take your eye off the ball.
[03:55] [Unknown]: Garcia has done it again.
[03:57] [Unknown]: He's done it again, again.
[04:05] [Unknown]: Really clever and it's really important.
[04:16] [Unknown]: That's nice, McHenry.
[04:18] [Unknown]: Long, fast leaders.
[04:21] [Unknown]: What a pass from Ishikawa and Miura finishes it off.
[04:26] [Unknown]: That was beautiful to watch.
[04:42] [Unknown]: Still option C for Japan.
[04:45] [Unknown]: One of them is the middle.
[04:48] [Unknown]: That was really well played.
[04:50] [Unknown]: Sato!
[05:00] [Unknown]: Well played, Ma.
[05:03] [Unknown]: Nowhere to go, and this is exactly what...
[05:11] [Unknown]: Off the net, not going to run the middle, Watt gets a good touch off.
[05:15] [Unknown]: Greater Iroh Miura.
[05:20] [Unknown]: Still not one to go the middle, and it's a massive block for Japan.
[05:26] [Unknown]: It's going to stay in play.
[05:33] [Unknown]: What can she now do with this?
[05:36] [Unknown]: Well played, Briggs.
[05:37] [Unknown]: Robinson.
[05:41] [Unknown]: Oh, Gallows on it.
[05:42] [Unknown]: Is she Gallows on it?
[05:42] [Unknown]: Free ball, USA.
[05:44] [Unknown]: Four attacking options all moving.
[05:47] [Unknown]: Garcia.
[05:50] [Unknown]: Well played, he's still going now then.
[05:54] [Unknown]: Is she Gallows for the pitch?
[05:55] [Unknown]: No, no, no, what a block, USA.
[06:03] [Unknown]: That's a good start.
[06:05] [Unknown]: I'm not very good at bounce.
[06:13] [Unknown]: Here's the breakboard chance.
[06:15] [Unknown]: Ooh, taken by Ewan.
[06:20] [Unknown]: That's close.
[06:26] [Unknown]: It's an ace from the aura!
[06:32] [Unknown]: He doesn't want to have any water, they want to let that mother bird.
[06:36] [Unknown]: Miora says, you're not going to get me this time.
[06:45] [Unknown]: He's fantastic at volleyball.
[06:54] [Unknown]: Many ways to get a point.
[07:02] [Unknown]: Oh, goodness me, Champlin!
[07:06] [Unknown]: By one chance and I'm good.
[07:08] [Unknown]: We're never going to go to Brooklyn.
[07:14] [Unknown]: It's not going to happen.
[07:15] [Unknown]: I can't count.
[07:20] [Unknown]: Hey!
[07:20] [Unknown]: Get up, get up, get up!
[07:23] [Unknown]: The media hasn't seen that once, even before the swing came.
[07:26] [Unknown]: The columns of numbers, some like me.
[07:30] [Unknown]: That, that is...
[07:32] [Unknown]: I'll see her again.
[07:35] [Unknown]: Lovely ball in this time.
[07:37] [Unknown]: Miora does the business.
[07:39] [Unknown]: He's so good at putting that ball.
[07:45] [Unknown]: Miora gets the free ball for his team.
[07:50] [Unknown]: Fantastic!
[07:55] [Unknown]: On a bearer.
[08:01] [Unknown]: Just got to keep making good decisions.
[08:04] [Unknown]: Focus on making good decisions.
[08:06] [Unknown]: Side-out is really important at the moment.
[08:13] [Unknown]: It's one of the best decisions on block and defence, and it has flicked.
[08:17] [Unknown]: Oh, there you go.
[08:18] [Unknown]: OK, so that's why Sato has not felt it, because it's caught the tape on the top of his finger.
[08:24] [Unknown]: It must have just brushed it.
[08:26] [Unknown]: Champlain.
[08:28] [Unknown]: One down, USA.
[08:31] [Unknown]: Looking to get leveled.
[08:36] [Unknown]: Oh, no, Sato.
[08:38] [Unknown]: Reaching over before you were smashed into him.
[08:40] [Unknown]: I think this is worth the challenge.
[08:42] [Unknown]: Yeah, look, contacts on his own side.
[08:44] [Unknown]: Or what's he saying about that little finger?
[08:48] [Unknown]: Very quality contact.
[08:50] [Unknown]: Successful.
[08:51] [Unknown]: Point prepared.
[08:55] [Unknown]: Here she comes.
[08:58] [Unknown]: Nice ball in.
[09:00] [Unknown]: Oh, that's some dig from Iroh.
[09:06] [Unknown]: Oh, wow.
[09:06] [Unknown]: That's up.
[09:07] [Unknown]: That is what...
[09:10] [Unknown]: Needs some consistent support, getting it in set three from Ewitt and Champlin.
[09:15] [Unknown]: That is a great block.
[09:19] [Unknown]: No, I was just thinking ahead for... Ewitt will be serving for USA.
[09:27] [Unknown]: He's put it on meter.
[09:30] [Unknown]: Solid swing from Tagashi Ran.
[09:39] [Unknown]: That's going to stay in play.
[09:44] [Unknown]: Tommy, to go for it.
[09:46] [Unknown]: Does a good up, Garcia.
[09:47] [Unknown]: He's out of the attack.
[09:48] [Unknown]: Champion has a little look.
[09:49] [Unknown]: It's a free ball, Japan.
[09:54] [Unknown]: That's well to it.
[09:56] [Unknown]: Land puts it away.
[09:57] [Unknown]: Japan take the match.
[09:59] [Unknown]: They're off to the finals.
